Open a file, use default settings, NOT at start of file
Make sure Edit bar is docked
Calc in 64 bit mode and hex mode
Close all toolbars

-------------------------
 " The Jump tools allow you to quickly jump to an address.
 " There is a hex jump tool and a decimal jump tool
 " They both reside on the Edit bar by default

- open Edit Bar

 " As usual the colours for addresses are displayed as for the active colour scheme
 " Here the hex jump tool uses red, decimal addresses are blue

 " The obvious thing about the jump tools is that you can type an address,
   and press Enter and you are taken to that address
   
- Enter 0 in hex address tool and press Enter
- Enter 256 in decimal address tool and press Enter

 " The next obvious things is that the tools have a history list
 
- Select 0 from the hex address history and press Enter

 " If you start to type an address and chnage your mind just press the Esc button
 
- Enter 999,999 then press Escape

 " If you try to jump to an address past the end of file a warning is displayed
 
- Enter 999,999,999 and press Enter

 " You might also have noticed that as you move around in the file the current
   address is displayed for you in the tools.  The tools also update to show
   the current address during long operations like compares and searches.

- move cursor around using keyboard and mouse
- select 256 from decimal history and press Enter

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 " You can not only type an address into the tools but any expression.
 " For example, say you wanted to jump forward 256 bytes in the file.
 " Just move to the decimal address tool and type "minus one thousand"
 
- append " + 256" to decimal address tool and press Enter

 " Note that the expression remains in the calculator so that you can make changes
   And any expression you enter is, of course, available from the history drop-down

- select from drop-down

 " Expressions in the calculator support all the operators of C/C++ expressions
   including assigning to variables.  This makes it very easy to remember an address.
   
- prepend "rec = " to decimal tool and press Enter
- Enter "rec + 512" into decimal tool and press Enter

 " When using variable names in the hex jump tool you must be careful that
   the variable name could not be interpreted hex integer literal
   
- Enter "AA = FF" into hex jump tool and press Enter

 " If you really need such a name precede it with an "@" symbol

- Enter "@AA = FF" into hex jump tool and press Enter

 " Of course, you don't need to do this in the decimal tool

- Enter "AA" into decimal jump tool and press Enter
- Enter "AA" into hex jump tool and press Enter
- Enter "@AA" into hex jump tool and press Enter

 " Note that any variables you create are retained in the registry
   These are "global" variables so you can also use them in the calculator

- bring up the Calc
- select Variables/Integer/rec
- select "=" button

 " You can also clear all variables here
 
- select Variables/Clear

 " While we have the calculator up you will notice that we also have the decimal and
   hex tool history lists availabkle here too
   
- select 999,999 from decimal jump history
- switch from hex to decimal mode to show the selected value
- close calculator

 " Variables are a bit like a bookmark but they don't relate to a specific file
 " In most cases it is better to create a bookmark. You can use the names of bookmarks
   for the current file in expressions too

- open bookmarks tools
- add bookmark called "b1024" at 1024
- enter expression "b1024 + 512" into decimal tool and press Enter

 " Finally, I should mention that these tools double for base conversion
 " As you type a value in one tool then the other tool is updated with the corresponding value
 " You can even customize a toolbar so that it has 2 decimal tools so you can enter an
   expression into one you can see thre result in the other
   
- Open cust dialog, create a new toolbar called JumpToolTest
- ctrl+drag 2 decimal jump tools to it, make the left one wider
- ctrl+drag hex jump tool to new toolbar
- Enter an expression into left tool "1+2+3<<4"

 " That should give you an idea of the power of the jump tools
   You can do similar things in the calculator but with even more
   operations available.  We'll look at the calcualtor soon.
