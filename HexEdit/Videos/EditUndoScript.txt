
" One of the best features that HexEdit has always had is its unlimited undo



" Unlike other hex editors and even text editors undo not only undoes file changes
  it also undoes formating changes.  This was a very cool feature that I first learnt
  to love when I first used the Brief text editor about 30 years ago.
  Unfortunately, many editors still do not support this.  For example if you
  carefully make a selection in the Visual Syudio text editor then accidentally
  press an arrow key and lose the selection you can't simply "indo" to get it back
  but must painstakingly repeat the process.
  
- demo making selection, pressing down arrow, use Edit -> Undo

" However



Undo
- view vs file level undo
- warning if undo change made in other window
- undo changes
- intelligent undo
- no redo (only use I have ever found is if undo too far)
