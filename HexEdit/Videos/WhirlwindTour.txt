---------------------------
Basic View

" This is a whirlwind tour of some of the more useful but less understood features of HexEdit.
  You probably won't use most of what you see here but you may discover a gem that saves you 
  time and trouble. This video will move fast so you need to pay attention or pause and replay bits.
  
" If you are new to hex editors then this video is NOT for you. I recommend that you look
  at the HexEdit Intro video before anything else.

" I guess the simplest place to start is to open a file in HexEdit and check out the display
  You have complete and simple control of how the file is displayed.
- open a file

" You can easily change the font size by holding down the Ctrl key & using the mouse wheel
- demo

" Or you can select any font and size using the Format Bar
- open format bar and change font and size

" Also on the format bar is the ruler toggle which shows ruler at the top of the screen
  which shows columns and other useful stuff
- click ruler button twice

" You can completely configure how the rulers look. There are actually 2 rulers - hex and decimal.
  Switching between hex and decimal addresses displays either the hex or decimal ruler
- toggle hex/dec addresses
  
" Also note that in general hex addresses are shown in red and decimal in blue. This colour coding
  is really useful as sometimes hex addresses can look like they are decimal. But the actual colours
  depend on the colour scheme. For the built-in colour schemes they are always RED and BLUE.
- click colour scheme drop list
  
" Also note these little handles on the ruler. You can double-click the column handle to turn on AutoFit
- drag group handle, double-click columns handle

" Or just use the AutoFit button. You can also change the number of columns with these buttons
- turn off AutoFit, use inc/dec cols buttons

" You can have a huge number of columns - up to 32,000 I think
- turn off Format Bar

Character Display

" Looking again at the standard toolbar you can see some very important drop down lists
  The glasses list determines how the bytes are shown on screen
- demo char and hex areas
- return to BOTH areas

" The BOTH option has a typical binary editor display but a lot of users requested an
  option where each byte is shown as a character with the corresponding hex digits stacked beneath
- demo stacked mode

" the next drop list determines how characters are displayed. The first 4 have always been in HexEdit
  but the bottom one "Code Page" allows you to use any Windows code page
- select code page option

" I'll probably add a Unicode option here soon but Unicode is  a bit of a problem as there
  is not a one-to-one relation between bytes and characters. Actually, this problem 
  occurs with some code pages since some characters have a lead-in byte. So what you
  see in the character area may not correspond to the exact text for multi-byte characters.
- open Doc/Display options page & switch to code page that demos multi-byte characters

" To change which code page is used you need to go into the Options dialog
- Select View/Character Set/Code Pages/More...
- select the code page drop list

~~~~ 1

Options Dialog

" Lets have a quick look at the Options dialog now
- expand 3 top-level tree nodes

" First - it's grouped into 3 sections. The bottom (Document) settings apply to the currently
  open file. You can see some of the same display settings for the file we are looking at.
- go to Document/General

" The middle section (Workspace) is for global display and editing settings.
- go to Workspace/Display

"  While the top (System) section is for everything else.
- go to first page

" There are a lot of things you can configure. A pretty basic one for a hex editor is how to
  display hex digits. Some people prefer lower case. Others hate that (since a little-B
  looks some much like a 6 but a capital B looks nothing like an 8). Here we can change how 
  hex digits are displayed everywhere in HexEdit.
- go to Workspace/Global
- toggle Hex In Uppercase

" There are lots more options, a few of which we will look at later. But let's just look at the display options.
- go back to Doc/Display page

" This page gives even more control over fonts, columns, etc. You'll notice that there are actually 3 
  different display fonts that are remembered for each file. The normal font is just for displaying
  simple English text and is used for ASCII, ANSI and EBCDIC char sets.
- select ASCII char set, open Normal font, select name, size, bold, etc

" However, the IBM/OEM has special requirements of its font - it must support MSDOS graphics characters.
  You can only select the few Windows fonts that do that.
- Select IBM/OEM char set, open font dialog

" Finally for codepage character sets we need a font that has lots of different
  characters - usually something with Unicode in the name like "Lucida Sans Unicode".
- select code page char set, open Multibyte font selection

" The Document Edit page has other useful settings.
- switch to next page

" One of my favourites is the scroll zone which sets
  how close to the edge of the screen you can get before the display starts scrolling.
- set scroll zone to 5, close Options and move cursor up/down to demo
- reopen Options dialog

" Also here you have these two important settings. First, you can avoid accidentally changing a file
  by making it read-only. Note the RO status bar panel
- select RO  

" You can also work in overtpe or insert mode. The default is overtype mode as most binary
  formats do not like having bytes inserted or deleted
- switch between INS and OVR modes
- close options dialog

~~~~ 2

Advanced View

" You can also toggle these options by double-clicking the status bar panel
- dclick RO and OVR panels

" If you have multiple windows open on the same file then you could have one read-only and one read-write
- turn off tabs, open new window, tile horizontally, make one RO and one RW, try to edit RO

" I should just quickly explain what these other std toolbar buttons are for. The star button just 
  adds the current file to the favourites category. You can put different files into different categories
  of you choice but the favourites category is special because it adds the file to the Favourites
  list that you see when you right-click the HexEdit button in the task bar.
- open Properties dialog and click Categories drop list

" This Properties dialog is very useful and I'll explain about Properties soon
- close Properties dialog

" The clock button just preserves the times of the file. So even if you change a file
  its time of last modification, attributes, etc won't change
  Note that there is currently a problem with access time not being preserved that I am working on
  
" These last 2 buttons are for keystroke macros which are a simple way to automate repeated
  things that you do in HexEdit. They are actually very powerful and I recommend the Macros
  tutorial if you are interested.
- open Help/Tutorial/Macros then close it
  
* Depending on your character set there may be several non-printing bytes which
  are often called control characters. For example, in ASCII the byte that is used for TAB
  has a value of nine. I will just create a file with all 256 byte values in it to demonstrate.
  To do this I use a keystroke macro I previously recorded and saved on disk.
- run AllChars macro and change to BOTH areas, ASCII char set

" If you switch to displaying control chars as Alpha the TAB is shown as a red-I, 
  because TAB is also CTRL-I or control plus I
- switch to Alpha control chars mode

" If you switch to C escape sequences mode then TAB is displayed as T,
  because in C, C++ and even C# TAB is represented by a backslash and T
- switch to C/C++ control chars mode  

" You can also see here that control characters are shown in RED,
  except for byte value 9, 10, and 13. These are shown differently as these are
  TAB, CR and LF which will normally appear in text files whereas the others do not.

Colour Schemes
  
" Actually the colour that the characters are displayed in is actually determined by the
  colour scheme. We are current using the ASCII default colour scheme but if I switch
  to EBCDIC character set HexEdit automatically switches to the EBCDIC default scheme.
- switch to EBCDIC

" But if we switch to a non-standard scheme then the automatic switching stops
- switch to Black & White

" You can actually set the colour each different byte or range of bytes will be displayed in
- select Modify colours, switch to ASCII default scheme

" Here we can set lots of different colours including those for hex and decimal addresses
  After the decimal addresses colour have the colours for byte ranges
- scroll down to ASCII Text

" Here we can see that normal text is BLACK.  TAB, CR, and LF are GREEN and all others are RED.
- scroll down one line

" You can enter a comma-separated list of values or a range
- scroll down one line

" Its probably a good idea to have the last entry with a range 0 to 255 to catch all values
  I think bytes with an unassigned colour are simply not displayed
- switch to MANY scheme

" These colour schemes are very useful for spotting unexpected values.
  They are especially useful in AERIAL VIEW mode which I will discuss in a minute
  I often use the MANY scheme where every byte value has a different colour
- scroll through the MANY colours

" Of course, you can change any of the colours and even create and delete your own schemes
- click New Scheme button then cancel
- select MANY scheme click Delete button

" I just deleted the MANY scheme but its easy to get back by using reset
- click New Scheme button call it "Many" then click Reset button

~~~~ 3

Basic Editing

- close Options dialog

" The rest of the buttons on the standard toolbar are typical things for saving, printing, etc.
- click then close print preview

" Of course, there is full clipboard support. Actually there are many cool clipboard
  facilities which I will discuss later
- select something and click copy button

" Undo in HexEdit is extremely powerful as it not only undoes file changes but also cursor moves,
  selections, and just about anything you can change. For example, if I move the cursor
- move cursor down 3 lines then up 3 lines
- select Undo button on toolbar

" If I set the mark I can undo that
- set mark a few times using context menu
- undo lots of time using Undo button

" I should explain this blue square. Every file has one special location called the
  MARK. You can use it to measure distance with the status bar, restrict search scope
  and lots of other things
- move cursor around and highlight distance to mark panel  

" The mark is very useful in keystroke macros, especially these options
- select Edit/Mark/Extend To Mark

" At this point I think we have looked at everything on the std toolbar so we should take a look
  at the Edit Bar
- turn on Edit Bar

" Here we have buttons to set the mark and jump to the mark as well as the hex and decimal jump tools
  some searching tools, and at the end the "change tracking" button allows you to see all changes you have
  made (even insertions and deletions) - basically how the file in memory differs from the file on disk
- move mouse over the Edit Bar buttons then select the highlighter  

Highlighter

" You can highlight a selected block using this button
- select a block then click highlight

" Or you can click the button to turn on highlighter mode
- click away, turn on highlighter, select a few blocks, make hole

" The highlighter is used in several areas where we need a disconnected selection
- open File/Export/Motorola-S and click the bottom-left checkbox, then cancel it

" There are a few more highlighter options on the Format Bar
- open format bar

" You can quickly go to next and previous highlighted sections
- demo

" You can hide the highlights without actually deleting them, although this is sometimes confusing.
  You might be better off just toning down the colour if you don't like so much yellow
- open colour schemes dialog, scroll up to Highlighting, select a lighter yellow

" The clear button just removes all highlights from the file
  Of course, if you click it by accident you can just undo
- click Highlight Clear button, click Undo button
- hide Format Bar

~~~~ 4

Jump Tools

" Very useful on the Edit Bar are the hex and decimal jump tools
  Just type an address and hit enter to jump to that address
- type FF into hex tool and press Enter

" Note that as you type into one tool the other tool is updated
  This is a quick way to do base conversion
- type 256 into decimal tool

" If you need to save an address you can just hit enter and it will be added to the history
- hit Enter then open drop-list

" You can also type in any C/C++ expression, including assigning to variables
- type "X=" in front of dec address (256) and hit Enter
- type X-250 into dec address tool and hit Enter to jump to address 6

" For even more powerful jumps just type Ctrl+G
  This invokes the calculator with the current address
- Invoke menu: Edit/Go To

Calculator

" You'll notice that becuase I am displaying hex addresses it has invoked the calculator
  in hex mode
- switch to decimal mode

" If I now click the "+" button and 100 and click GO the cursor id moved forward 100 bytes
- click +, 1, 0, 0, GO

" I can't cover everything about the calculator so see the special video.
  But these drop down lists at the top are related to the jump tools.
  Here we have the history lists from the hex and decimal jump tools
- click on lists

" Plus just like the jump tools you can enter any expression
  You can also select any variable you have created
- look if Vars list

" You can also see all the functions that you can use in expressions
- select strlen then enter "ABC" to get value 3

" The only other thing to watch out for when working with addresses is 
  the bits setting. If you are working with very big file you
  probably want to use 64 bit integers
- click 64-bit radio button

" Also be careful that you know whether you are in hex or decimal
  mode - though the colour scheme (red for hex, bluer for decimal)
  should make it obvious
- switch between hex and decimal modes

" Also note that when you switched to decimal mode that the SIGNED
  checkbox is silently turned on since decimal mode is often used with
  negative values
- switch to decimal, turn off signed

- bits display
- expr display and precedence

" These buttons on the left allow you to modify the file and do other
  powerful things in keystroke macros but we have no more time to look
  at the calculator
- close calculator

~~~~~ 5

Searching

" The other really cool tool is the search tool (on the Edit Bar)
  You can search for hex digits
- type "414243" into the tool and hit Enter

" Or you can look for a string in the current character set
  by first typing EQUALS
- type "=ABC" and hit Enter

" For a case-insensitive search use a TILDE
- type "~XYZ"

" You can also use the search tool to do conversions
  between character sets. Say you have 41 42 43 in ASCII.
  Make sure you are in ASCII mode and put an EQUALS sign at the
  start and you can see that these values correspond to ABC in ASCII
- switch to ASCII char set
- enter "414243" into find tool, then put EQUALS at start

" Now if you switch to the EBCDIC character set you can see
  the corresponding byte values in EBCDIC
- switch to EBCDIC mode, delete EQUALS to get C1 C2 C3

" Once you search for something all occurrences are found
  using a background task because background search is on
- open Options/Workspace/Background, check/uncheck search checkbox

" You can also see in the search panel the number of occurrences found
  and the current occurrence. If I press F3 I move to the next occurrence
- count

" If I double-click the search panel I can bring up the search dialog
  Here we have 5 different pages for different types of searches
- switch to Basic page

" The BASIC page lets you quickly search for text but you can type hex
  digits to search for any binary pattern. Maybe FILE scope needs explaining
- turn on WHOLE FILE scope

" For WHOLE FILE it starts at the top of the file (if direction is DOWN)
  but after the first occurrence is found it switches to END OF FILE
  mode in order to find the subsequent occurrences
- click FIND NEXT

" Of course, if direction is UP then it works in reverse
- click UP button

" The HEX page just lets you search for binary data
  Here there are a couple more really useful options
  First you can use the mask to ignore bits
- switch to Hex page, click USE MASK and enter "0F0F0F"

" The alignment options are also very useful, for example if you wanted to only
  search the 3rd byte of each 30-byte record
- set stride to 30 and offset to 3

" The relative to mark might be used if there was say a 100-byte header at the start
  of file.  You would set the mark at the start of the first record and use this check box
- select RELATIVE TO MARK

" The TEXT page lets you choose which character set to search in including Unicode
- switch to Text page

" The numbers page lets you find certain values. A lot of gamers use this to find
  and modify saved game files, not that I condone that.
  I should also explain how you can bookmark all occurrences of the number searched for.
  For example, say I want to find all occurrences of 100 as a 32-bit signed integer.
  We can give a prefix to our bookmarks so we can differentiate them.

- Enter 100, select signed, double word, change prefix
- select Bookmark all

~~~~ 6

Bookmarks

" I guess now is a good time to open the bookmarks dialog
- open it

" You can sort the bookmarks on their name, file name, etc
- right click col header and turn on mod time, turn off folders

" An idea unique to bookmarks in HexEdit is that they retain
  time of mosification and access. Modifcation time is when you 
  created or last moved the bookmark, Access time is when you
  last jumped to it. I use a lot of bookmarks and this helps
  me find one that I may have forgotten the name of.
- sort by modification time

" USing these buttons at the top you can easily delete or
  remove old bookmarks that no longer point to a real file
- click VALIDATE button

" Jumping to a bookmark will open the file if it is not open
  You can use this button OR more easily just double-click.
- select a bookmark and click JUMP button

" This button will create a bookmark at the current cursor posn
- select a location in the active file, click NEW BOOKMARK button

" You can use the default name or just type a new name a press Enter
- type "whirlwind" and press Enter

" A quicker way to create a bookmark is just to press Ctrl+F2
- got to file and press Ctrl+F2

" You can press F2 to move to the next bookmark (or SF2 for previous)
- open Navigation bar and select BookMark/Next

" OR right-click any bookmark to get a context menu
  This menu (like all in HexEdit) can be customised to your prefs
- open Tools/Customize/Menu/Bookmarks (3rd in list)

" Finally notice how the mouse changes to a hand when you hover over
  a bookmark. This indicates that you can move the bookmark by
  dragging it. HexEdit will make sure the bookmarks stay in place
  when you insert or delete bytes but for different reasons I
  find that bookmarks tend to get slightly out of place.
- demo moving a bookmark

" If INFOTIPS are on then you will also notice a little yellow
  window that pops up when you hold the mouse over the bookmark
  This is just one example of an INFOTIP which are
  completely configurable
- Open Tools/Options/Workspace/Info Tips

~~~~ 7

Tool Windows

" While we are talking about bookmarks I should explain the other
  TOOL windows which you can see in the Toolbars list though
  they are not really toolbars
- menu: View/Toolbars/Bookmarks - to hide the bookmarks dialog

" If you right-click the menu bar you get a list of toolbars and
  windows. Some people call them Tool windows but I
  call them modeless dialogs - meaning they can stay open and be
  available for use at any time
- right-click menu bar

" We have seen the Calculator, Find and Bookmarks windows
  Another important one is the Properties window
- select Properties to open the window

" You can drag and dock them to the main window or each other
- drag and dock at bottom

" If you are short of screen space you can also click this PIN
  to have them AUTO-HIDE
- click PIN, move back to show the window, re-click PIN

" Finally, if you ever can't find a TOOL window or have some other
  problem you can reset all the TOOL window positions
- menu: Help/Detect & Repair/Restore Dialog Layout
- close Calc & Calc Tape, Compare List
- show Properties if behind Find

Properties

" The Properties dialog is one of the original features of HexEdit
  from 1999 and still one of the most useful.
- flip between Summary, File and Byte pages

" As you move around in the file the values update to reflect the
  bytes at the cursor
- move cursot to see bytes change

" Better yet you can enter value to change the file
- go to number page and enter 111,111,111 into 32-bit field

" It supports different signed integer, and many different
  floating point and date formats
- switch to Float page, select Turbo Real48
- switch to Date page, select time64_t

" You can even toggle individual bits by double-clicking in
  the Binary value field
- switch to Byte page, dclick bits unto all off

" THe File page shows info about the file as it exists on disk
- switch to File page

" The length field also shows the difference if bytes have
  been inserted or deleted
- delete a few bytes in the active file

" The COUNTS page shows a graph with the count for each byte
- switch to Count page, make dialog bigger

" It uses the current colour scheme
- switch to MANY colour scheme

" If you hold the mouse over any column you can see a tip
  with the actual count
- hold over some columns then column zero

" You can see that the values are fairly randomly dictributed
  about 2.5 million for each byte value except there are a few
  more NUL bytes (about 3.5 million)

" The STATS page shows values calculated from the file
- Open Stats page

" These values are calculated in the background when you open
  the file as long as you have background statistics turned ON
- Open OPtions/WorkSpace/Background Processes, turn OFF stats

" The Bitmap page is only used if you have preview view of
  a graphics file open
- switch to Bitmap page
- open SMALL.BMP file from history, open preview

" If you modify the bitmap in memory you can see the difference
  between memory and disk
- change a pixel, view Bitmap page

" Actually both memory and disk have the same header.
  We can modify the header by opening the BMP template
- menu: Template/Open File Type/Bitmap Image (.BMP)
- expand tree view and chnage row from 2 to 4

" The Summary page lets you keep extra info about a file
  We already saw the STAR button on the std toolbar which
  adds a file to the FAVOURITES category but you can
  add any other categories that you want
- switch to Summary page
- add a new category of WHIRLWIND

" You can sort by categories in the Recent File List and the
  Explorer Window
- open Explorer window, turn on Category column
- open a file and enter category of WHIRLWIND

~~~~ 8

Recent File List

" You can also see categories of files in the Recent File dialog
- menu: File/Recent Files
- right-click column header and turn on Category

" HexEdit will remember every file that you have ever opened as
  well as other things like formatting, highlighting, comments, etc
- close RFL
- Open Options/System/History, select "clear recent file list"

" Of course you can also manually remove files
- reopen recent file list
- select a few files and click REMOVE button

" But if you chnage your mind and don't want to modify the list
  just close without hitting the SAVE button
- click X, then re-open the recent file list

" You can also quickly get rid of any file from the list that
  are no longer present on disk
- click VALIDATE ALL button

" I find the recent file list is fantastic for finding files that
  you have previously opened. I don't know about you but whenever
  I go to use the RECENT FILES list in Word, Excel, VS or whatever
  I often find that the file I am interested in has dropped off
  the end.
- select SIZE and some other columns

" You can sort the list by any of these columns- f
- sort by size

" Finally you can also search for a word. This works great for the
  category and keyword columns
- click SEARCH enter "WHIRLWIND"

Explorer Window

" The Explorer windows work just like Windows File Explorer but
  it integrates with HexEdit and has some extra capabilities
- expand tree view

" First you will notice these 2 edit controls with history lists
  at the top of the Explorer windows. One is current directory
  with full history list of places you have been to
- type "C:\" into ADDRESS control
- click drop down button to see history, select C:\temp

" The top one allows you to filter which files you see
- type "*.XML" into the FILTER control
- open drop list and select *.tmp

" You can also select a pre-defined filter that you can
  set up in the FILE TYPE FILTERS list in the Options dialog
- click FILTER LIST button to open Options/System/Files/File Filters
- turn on *.XML and click OK

" However, what is really cool about the Explorer Tool Window
  is how easily you can perform many operations on files
- select *.* filter

" If you right-click a file you get a double menu - on the right is
  the normal Windows menu but on the left are things added by HexEdit
- make sure Attributes column is visible
- right-click a file

" You can very easily set any of the file flags
- set RO flag

" You can aslo set some of thes in the Properties dialog
- right-click a file and select Properties, turn off RO

" But you can toggle the SYSTEM flag which you cannot do in
  Explorer or any other program I have seen
- right-click a file and select Properties, toggle SYSTEM flag

" It's also very easy to set file times. If you have a DATE
  variable with a date and time you can instantly set
  file modification time for many file at once
- quickly create a DATE variable in the Calculator by typing
  WHIRLWIND=DATE("04/05/2016 01:02:03")
- right-click a file and select Set Modified Time/WHIRLWIND

" The other useful option is to be able to wipe a file
  If you just delete a file the blocks of the file are put on
  the free list but there is no guarantee when or even if
  those blocks will ever be overwritten
- right-click a file and select DELETE

" The WIPE option overwrites all data of the file first
- right-click a file and select WIPE

" For extra security you can overwrite the data many times
  using different algorithms
- right-click the file and select Options

" The THOROUGH option is some sort of NSA recommended
  standard but really the GOOD strategy is more than enough
- select THOROUGH and click OK

" The Open in HexEdit, Open Read-Only and Open Shared options
  open the file just as if you had used the File Open dialog
- right-click T.XML and select Open in HexEdit
- menu: File/Open

~~~~ 9

File Handling

" Here we can see that we are looking in the wrong directory. I
  expected to be in the same directory as the file that is open
- menu: Options/System/Files/File Folders/Default=Active Doc
- menu: File/Open

" It is important to notice these check boxes in the File Open
  dialog which control how a file is opened. For example, if
  a file is opened shareable then other software can modify
  it and HexEdit will warn you since the displayed bytes are
  drawn straight from the file and the display can change
  unexpectedly
- turn on shareable check box and open SMALL.BMP

" While we are looking at File Open we should have a quick look
  at FILE NEW
- menu: File/New

" This dialog allows you to create a file filled in just about
  any way I could think of. One thing people don't notice is
  that you can fill with floating point numbers if you type 
  a decimal point in the number field
- select Number, type 3.14159, switch to IEEE 64-bit

" I didn't realise but there is no option here for IBM
  floating points, or C# decimal but nobody has complained yet

" Why don't we gererate a 1 Megabyte file full of Code64
  data. This is where binary data is encoded as text
  characters consisting of uppercase, and lowercase letters,
  plus digits and the + and / characters
- select SPECIFIED, "1,000,000"

" The allowed ASCII values are 43 for +, 47 for slash,
  48 to 57 for digits 65 to 90 for uppercase and
  97 to 122 for lowercase
- select RANDOM "43, 47, 48-57, 65-90, 97-122"
- click OK

" We can see the distribution of bytes in the COUNTS page
- open Properties dialog, select Counts page

" This is what Code64 data (as used in MIME) looks like.
  Actually it would look a bit different to this unless
  the binary data that was encoded was fairly random

" We can also see that the bytes are farily random by
  looking at the aerial view
- menu: Aerial/Tabbed Aerial View
- change to the other tab

~~~~ 10

View Windows

" I guess it is now time to explain about Aerial view and
  the 3 other view windows you can have open for any file
  These open special views which allow you to look at the
  data in different ways. They correpsond to the 4 menus:
  TEMPLATE, AERIAL, PREVIEW and COMPARE
- move mouse over the 4 menus

" Each special view can be displayed in a split window
  ot a tabbed window or hidden
- move mouse over Aerial menu commands: Hide/Split/Tabbed

" WE can switch the Aerial view from a tabbed window to
  a split window
- menu: Aerial/Split Window

" You can also configure these all in one place in the
  Document/General page
- menu: Options/Document/General

  - aerial view
  - preview
  - compare view

~~~~ 11

  - templates

~~~~ 12

" There is still a lot I have not covered like
  keystroke macros and all the things on the
  operations menu

- compression
  - giant files
- CRC
- encryption

" I was about to wrap this up but I just remembered One more 
  thing that is very useful - that is INFOTIPS
  We saw before that if you hold the mouse
  over a bookmark then a little tip window pops up
