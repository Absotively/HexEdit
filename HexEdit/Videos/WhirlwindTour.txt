Basic View

" This is a whirlwind tour of some of the more useful but less understood features of HexEdit.
  You probably won't use most of what you see here but you may discover a gem that saves you 
  time and trouble. This video will move fast so you need to pay attention or pause and replay bits.
  
" If you are new to hex editors then this video is NOT for you. I recommend that you look
  at the HexEdit Intro video before anything else.

" I guess the simplest place to start is to open a file in HexEdit and check out the display
  You have complete and simple control of how the file is displayed.
- open a file

" You can easily change the font size by holding down the Ctrl key & using the mouse wheel
- demo

" Or you can select any font and size using the Format Bar
- open format bar and change font and size

" Also on the format bar is the ruler toggle which shows ruler at the top of the screen
  which shows columns and other useful stuff
- click ruler button twice

" You can completely configure how the rulers look. There are actually 2 rulers - hex and decimal.
  Switching between hex and decimal addresses displays either the hex or decimal ruler
- toggle hex/dec addresses
  
" Also note that in general hex addresses are shown in red and decimal in blue. This colour coding
  is really useful as sometimes hex addresses can look like they are decimal. But the actual colours
  depend on the colour scheme but for the standard colour schemes they are always red and blue.
- click colour scheme drop list
  
" Also note these little handles on the ruler. You can double-click the column handle to turn on AutoFit
- drag group handle, double-click columns handle

" Or just use the AutoFit button. You can also change the number of columns with these buttons
- turn off AutoFit, use inc/dec cols buttons

" You can have a huge number of columns - up to 32,000 I think
- turn off Format Bar

" Looking again at the standard toolbar you can see some very important drop down lists
  The glasses list determines how the bytes are shown on screen
- demo char and hex areas
- return to BOTH areas

" The BOTH option has a typical binary editor display but a lot of users requested an
  option where each byte is shown as a character with the corresponding hex digits stacked beneath
- demo stacked mode

" the next drop list determines how characters are displayed. The first 4 have always been in HexEdit
  but the bottom one "Code Page" allows you to use any Windows code page
- select code page option

" I'll probably add a Unicode option here soon but Unicode is  a bit of a problem as there
  is not a one-to-one relation between bytes and characters. Technically, the same problem 
  occurs with some code pages since some characters have a lead-in byte
- open Doc/Display options page & switch to code page that demos multi-byte characters

" To change which code page is used you need to go into the Options dialog
- open Options dialog again

~~~~ 1

Options Dialog

" Lets have a quick look at the Options dialog now
- expand 3 top-level tree nodes

" First notice that its grouped into 3 sections. The bottom (Document) settings apply to the currently
  open file.  The middle section (Workspace) is for global display and editing settings.
  While the top (System) section is for everything else.
- go to Workspace/Global

" Some people prefer hex digits to be in lower case. Others hate that (since a little-B
  looks some much like a 6 but a capital B looks nothing like an 8). Here we can change how 
  hex digits are displayed everywhere in HexEdit.
- toggle Hex In Uppercase

" There are lots more options, a few of which we will look at later. But let's just look at the display options.
- go back to Doc/Display page

" This page gives even more control over fonts, columns, etc. You'll notice that there are actually 3 
  different display fonts that are remembered for each file. The normal font is just for displaying
  simple English text and is used for ASCII, ANSI and EBCDIC char sets. However, the IBM/OEM has special
  requirements of its font - it must support MSDOS graphics characters - there are only a few Windows
  fonts that do that.
 - select ASCII char set, open Normal font, select name, size, bold, etc
  
" Finally for codepage character sets we need a font that has lots of different
  characters - usually something with Unicode in the name like "Lucida Sans Unicode".
- open Multibyte font selection

" The Document Edit page has other useful settings.
- switch to next page

" One of my favourites is the scroll zone which sets
  how close to the edge of the screen you can get before the display starts scrolling.
- set scroll zone to 99, close Options and move cursor up/down
- reopen Options dialog

" Also here you have these two important settings. First, you can avoid accidentally changing a file
  by making it read-only. Note the RO status bar panel
- select RO  

" You can also work in overtpe or insert mode. Generally you work in overtype mode as most binary
  format do not like having bytes inserted or deleted
- switch between INS and OVR modes
- close options dialog

~~~~ 2

Advanced View

" You can also toggle these options by double-clicking the status bar panel
- dclick RO and OVR panels

" If you have multiple windows open on the same file then you could have one RO
- turn off tabs, open new window, tile horizontally, make one RO and one RW, try to edit RO

" I should just quickly explain what these other std toolbar buttons are for. The star button just 
  adds the current file to the favourites category. You can put different files into different categories
  of you choice but the favourites category is special because it adds the file to the Favourites
  list that you see when you right-click the HexEdit button in the task bar.
- open Properties dialog and click Categories drop list

" This Properties dialog is very useful and I'll explain about Properties soon
- close Properties dialog

" The clock button just preserves the times of the file. So even if you change a file
  its time of last modification, attributes, etc won't change
  Note that there is currently a problem with access time not being preserved that I am working on
  
" These last 2 buttons are for keystroke macros which are a simple way to automate repeated
  things that you do in HexEdit. They are actually very powerful and I recommend the Macros
  tutorial if you are interested.
- open Help/Tutorial/Macros then close it
  
* Depending on your character set there may be several non-printing bytes which
  are often called control characters. For example, in ASCII the byte that is used for TAB
  has a value of nine. I will just create a file with all 256 byte values in it to demonstrate.
  To do this I use a keystroke macro I previously recorded and saved on disk.
- run AllChars macro and change to BOTH areas, ASCII char set

" If you switch to displaying control chars as Alpha the TAB is shown as a red-I, 
  because TAB is also CTRL-I or control plus I
- switch to Alpha control chars mode

" If you switch to C escape sequences mode then TAB is displayed as T,
  because in C/C++/C# TAB is represented by a backslash and T
- switch to C/C++ control chars mode  

" You can also see here that control characters are shown in RED,
  except to byte value 9, 10, and 13. These are shown differently as these are
  TAB, CR and LF which will normally appear in text files whereas the others do not.

Colour Schemes
  
" Actually the colour that the characters are displayed in is actually determined by the
  colour scheme. We are current using the ASCII default colour scheme but if I switch
  to EBCDIC character set HexEdit automatically switches to the EBCDIC default scheme.
- switch to EBCDIC

" But if we switch to a non-standard scheme then the automatic switching stops
- switch to Black & White

" You can actually set the colour each different byte or range of bytes will be displayed in
- select Modify colours, switch to ASCII default scheme

" Here we can set lots of different colours including those for hex and decimal addresses
  After the decimal addresses colour have the colours for byte ranges
- scroll down to ASCII Text

" Here we can see that normal text is BLACK.  TAB,CR, and LF are GREEN and all others are RED.
- scroll down one line

" Here you can enter a comma-separated list of values or a range
- scroll down one line

" Its probably a good idea to have the last entry with a range 0 to 255 to catch all values
  I think bytes with an unassigned colour are simply not displayed
- switch to MANY scheme

" These colour schemes are very useful for spotting unexpected values.
  They are especially useful in AERIAL VIEW mode which I will discuss in a minute
  I usually use the MANY scheme where every byte value has a different colour
- scroll through the MANY colours

" Of course, you can change any of the colours and even create and delete your own schemes
- click New Scheme button then cancel
- select MANY scheme click Delete button

" I just deleted the MANY scheme but its easy to get back by using reset
- click New Scheme button call it "Many" then click Reset button

~~~~ 3

Basic Editing

" The rest of the buttons on the standard toolbar are typical things for saving, printing, etc.
- click then close print preview

" Of course, there is full clipboard support. Actually there a many cool keyboard option
  which I will discuss later
- select something and click copy button

" Undo in HexEdit is extremely powerful as it not undoes file changes but also cursor moves,
  selections, and just about anything you can change. For example, if I move the cursor
- move cursor down 3 lines then up 3 lines
- select Undo button on toolbar

" If I set the mark I can undo that
- set mark a few times using context menu
- undo lots of time using Undo button

" I should explain this blue square called the mark. Every file has one special location called the
  mark. You can use it to measure distance using the status bar, restrict search scope
- move cursor around and highlight distance to mark panel  

" The mark is very useful in keystroke macros, especially these options
- select Edit/Mark/Extend To Mark

" At this point I think we have looked at everything on the std toolbar so we should take a look
  at the Edit Bar
- turn on Edit Bar

" Here we have buttons to set the mark and jump to the mark as well as the hex and decimal jump tools
  some searching tools, and this end "change tracking" button allows you to see all changes you have
  made (even insertions and deletions) - basically how the file in memory differs from the file on disk
- move mouse over the Edit Bar buttons then select the highlighter  

Highlighter

" You can highlight a selected block using this button
- select a block then click highlight

" Or you can click the button to turn on highlighter mode
- click away, turn on highlighter, select a few blocks, make hole

" The highlighter is used in several areas where we need a disconnected selection
- open File/Export/Motorola-S and click the bottom-left checkbox, then cancel it

" There are a few more highlighter options on the Format Bar
- open format bar

" You can quickly go to next and previous highlighted sections
- demo

" You can hide the highlights without actually deleting them, although this is sometimes confusing.
  You might be better off just toning down the colour if you don't like so much yellow
- open colour schemes dialog, scroll up to Highlighting, select a lighter yellow

" The clear button just removes all highlights from the file
  Of course, if you click it by accident you can just undo
- click Highlight Clear button, click Undo button
- hide Format Bar

~~~~ 4

Jump Tools

" Also notice on the Edit Bar the hex and decimal jump tools
  Just type an address and hit enter to jump to that address
- type FF into hex tool and press Enter

" Note that as you type into one tool the other tool is updated
  This is a quick way to do conversion between hex and decimal
- type 256 into decimal tool

" You can also type in any C/C++ expression, including assigning to variables
- type "X=" in front of dec address (256) and hit Enter
- type X-250 into dec address tool and hit Enter to jump to address 6

" For even more powerful jumps just type Ctrl+G
  This invokes the calculator with the current address
- Invoke Edit/Go To

" You'll notice that becuase I am displaying hex addresses it has invoked the calculator
  in hex mode
- switch to decimal mode

" If I now click the "+" button the 100 and click GO the cursor id moved forward 100 bytes
- click +, 1, 0, 0, GO

" There's a lot more to the calculator and I think I created a separate video for it
  It is particularly useful when used in keystroke macros
  But I guess these drop down lists at the top are the most relevant
  Here we have the history lists from the hex and decimal jump tools
- click on lists

" Just like the jump tools you can enter any expression
  But you also have the ability to find any variable you have created
- look if Vars list

" You can also see all the functions that you can use in expressions
- select strlen then enter "ABC" to get value 3

" The only other thing to watch out for when working with addresses is 
  the bits setting. If you are working with very big file you
  probably want to use 64 bit integers
- click 64-bit radio button

" Also be carefule that you know whether you are in hex or decimal
  mode - though the colour scheme (red for hex, bluer for decimal)
  should make it obvious
- switch between hex and decimal modes

" Also note that when you switched to decimal mode that the SIGNED
  checkbox is silenetly turned on since decimal mode is often used with -ves
- switch to decimal, turn off signed

" These buttons on the left allow you to modify the file and do other
  powerful things in keystroke macros but we have no more time to look
  at the calculator
- close calculator

~~~~~ 5

Searching

" The other really cool tool is the search tool
  You can search for hex digits
- type "414243" into the tool and hit Enter

" Or you can look for a string in the current character set
  by first typing EQUALS
- type "=ABC" and hit Enter

" For a case-insensitive search use a TILDE
- type "~XYZ"

" You can also use the search tool to do conversions
  between character sets. Say you have 41 42 43 in ASCII.
  Make sure you are in ASCII mode and put an EQUALS sign at the
  start and you can see that these value correspond to ABC in ASCII
- enter "414243" into find tool, then put EQUALS at start

" Now if you switch to the EBCDIC character set you can see
  the corresponding byte values in EBCDIC
- switch to EBCDIC mode, delete EQUALS to get C1 C2 C3

" Note that all occurrences in the file have been found
  because background search is on
- open Options/Workspace/Background, check/uncheck search checkbox

" You can also see in the search panel the number of occurrences found
  and the current occurrence. If I press F3 I move to the next occurrence
- count

" If I double-click the search panel I can bring up the search dialog
  Here we have 5 different pages for different types of searches
- switch to Basic page

" The BASIC page lets you quickly search for text but if you type only
  hex digits then it does a binary search. Maybe FILE scope needs explaining
- turn on WHOLE FILE scope

" For WHOLE FILE it starts at the top of the file (if direction is DOWN)
  but after the first occurrence is found it switches to END OF FILE
  mode in order to find the subsequent occurrences
- click FIND NEXT

" Of course, if direction is UP then it works in reverse
- click UP

" The HEX page just lets you search for binary data
  Here there are a couple more really useful options
  First you can use the mask to ignore bits
- click USE MASK and enter "0F0F0F"

" The alignment options are also very useful, for example if you wanted to only
  search the 3rd byte of each 30-byte record
- set stride to 30 and offset to 3

" The relative to mark might be used if there was say a 100-byte header at the start
  of file.  You would set the mark at the start of the first record and use this check box
- select RELATIVE TO MARK

" The TEXT page
