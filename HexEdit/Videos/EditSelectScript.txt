--------------------
 " This time we're going to talk about selecting which is a fundamental feature of any editor.
   You are probably already familiar with selecting so you may think this is a fairly
   simple topic and it *is*, but there *are* a few things that are not that obvious.
Open hexedit.exe

 " Many commands in HexEdit make use of the selection.
   For example if you do a search the found bytes are automatically selected.
- Type ~program into search tool and press Enter
 
 " You should become familiar with the advanced selection options to get the most out of HexEdit.

 " You probably know how to select a block of bytes using the mouse or keyboard.
   Just click and drag with the mouse or ...
demo mouse sel
 " ... hold down SHIFT while using the cursor keys to select using the kb.
demo kb sel

~~~~1

 " There are a large number of cursor movement keys which extend the selection if you also hold down
   the SHIFT key.  For example, just as Ctrl+Home takes you to the start of the file, Ctrl+Shift+Home
   selects everything from the current position to start of file.
select to start of file

 " HexEdit like most Windows programs allows you to press Ctrl+A to select everything.
demo

 " You might also have noticed that as you are making a selection a small yellow "tip" window appears.
   This shows the length of the selection in either hex or decimal depending on how addresses are currently
   being shown.  If I switch to decimal addresses you can see that the length is now shown in decimal -
   it's also in blue as determined by the current colour scheme.
leave/make large selection and show tip window
switch to decimal addresses and show tip window

~~~~2

 " You can turn off this tip window if you want to in the the Workspace/Display page of the Options dialog.
open options dialog - ws/display page

 " There is also an option here to show some extra info about the selection length - that is what power
   of 2 the selection length is exactly divisible by.  For example, if the length is an odd value then
   this will just show 1.
Turn on sel len div by power of 2
Show sel length when selecting lines

 " This is very useful information as some commands and operations that work on the selection have
   requirements about the length of the selection.  For example, some block encryption algorithms work
   on blocks of 64-bits at a time - in this case the selection length must at least be a multiple of 8.

 " Remember that you can show the tip window at any time simply by holding down the SHIFT key

~~~~3

 " There are several features you should be aware of if you need to make large selections.
   First if you try to select past the edge of the screen then HexEdit will automatically
   scroll the screen for you.  This is called "autoscroll" in many programs.
demo with kb

 " If you are selecting with the mouse then the further you drag the mouse past the edge of the screen
   theh the faster the scrolling becomes.  This is called "autoscroll acceleration".
demo acceleration

 " You can actually adjust the autoscroll acceleration using the Options dialog.
open options dialog - ws/display page

 " If you drag the slider to the right you increase the acceleration
   Drag it all the way to the left for a constant speed.
demo constant autoscroll

 " If you need to make a large selection then even with a fast autoscroll it can take a long time.
   A better way is to click the start of the selection then use the scroll bar to move to the end of the
   selection then SHIFT-click.
demonstrate

~~~~4

 " Another nice feature is that like everything in HexEdit selections are undoable.  So if you carefully
   make a selection then accidentally click on the window and lose your selection then you can easily
   just press Ctrl+Z to get it back.
demo 

 " Another way to make a selection is to use the "Extend to mark" command.  This is useful if you want to
   enter the exact start and end address using the calculator or jump tool.  For example, say I want to
   make a selection that starts at 10000 (hex) - I can use the calculator to move to that address -
   actually I can click the Mark Set button to set the address
Open calculator and enter 1 0000 in hex mode - click GOTO and also click Set Mark
 " And I want the selection to go to 40000 (hex) - I move the current cursor position using the calc GOTO
Enter 4 0000 in calculator and press GOTO
 " Now I can selection everything from the mark to the current cursor pos using this command ...
Select Edit/Mark/Extend To Mark

 " This is also useful in huge files, where the scrollbar becomes pretty much useless for
   positioning.  If you have a file that is hundreds of GBytes in size then a tiny adjustment of
   the scrollbar can jump hundreds of MBytes.
   I will talk about this a bit more in a later video on working with large files.

~~~~5
 " As I mentioned before, there are a very large number of commands and operations that use the selection.
   If you find a menu item disabled it may be because there is no selection.  For example, the
   Export commands are disabled unless there is a selection.

 " Some operations are even more picky requiring the selection to be a certain length.
   For example, if you want to add the value 5 to all the double word values of a selection,
   then the selection needs to be a multiple of 4 (the size of a double-word).
   I can demonstrate this but first we need to put 5 into the calculator
   and make sure that the size is no more than 32 bits.
demo

 " Finally, here are a few more tips.  First if you double-click the address area then this
   will select a single line which is useful if the line length has been set to a fixed record length.
demo
 " Actually the double-click commands can be changed in the "Customize" dialog but by default it selects
   the current line.
show?

 " Another convenience is that right-clicking on the selection brings up the selection context menu.
   Again you can configure this menu in the "Customize" dialog by adding new commands.
show?

 " Probably the most common use of the selection is for copying and cutting to the clipboard.
   There are also commands for writing and appending to file on the Edit menu.
   All these things will be discussed in later videos on editing.
