Open RFL and delete _ani.xml, hide Category column
Turn off allow docking
Open file and make RO
Open Properties dialog ...
Open _bmp.xml file, add category of "FixThis" change pages, and close file
adjust Properties dlg posn (left of visible area), turn off BE, reset formats, close dlg
Open HexEdit Explorer window and reposn, change to HexEdit dir
Turn on modeless dlgs move out of the way option

----------------------
 " The Properties dialog has been in HexEdit since version 1.0 and is something
   that people have always loved as it packs a huge amount of power in a small
   window.  It allows you to look at and even modify data in a multitude of ways.
- open Properties dialog (View/Properties)

 " One of the really useful features of the Properties dialog is that it is a
   so-called "modeless" dialog, which means you can leave it open.
   It's always right there when you need it.
- reposition dialog (leave floating)

 " Like all the modeless dialogs in HexEdit its dockable.
- dock to left side

 " But since I don't have much screen space for this demo I am going to leave it
   floating. You can just double-click the title bar to dock or undock
- dclick to undock

 " I'll also turn off the option where floating dialogs move out of the way
   so we can concentrate on the dialog and not what is happening behind it.
- open Options dialog to Workspace/Global page and turn off the option

~~~~1

 " Most of the fields in the Properties dialog show information about the bytes
   following the current cursor posn.
- switch to Integer page

 " As you move the cursor around the info is automatically updated for the current
   cursor location.
- move the cursor to show byte page fields changing

 " You can also edit most of the fields. But you can see that at the moment
   all the fields are grey indicating they can't be changed.  This is because
   the window is read-only.
- widen window on left and toggle allow changes button on toolbar

 " Now you can see that I can enter values in most of the fields.
- enter 44 into 16-bit integer field

 " If you start to enter a field but change your mind just press Escape.
- enter 77 into 64-bit field and press Escape

 " OR hit Enter to make the change
- enter 64 and press Enter

~~~~2

 " You'll note that the changed bytes are selected.  Of course, if you make
   changes through the Properties dialog by accident you can just undo them.
- undo changes using Edit/Undo

 " You can view or enter integers in many different formats.  On the other pages
   there are also many options for different floating point and date formats.
- switch to floating point page and show formats in drop-down

 " I will discuss all these formats in detail in the next video
- switch to date page and show formats in the drop-down

 " The byte page allows you to see the current byte in any character set.
- switch to Byte page

 " On the right you can see the current character in ASCII or Unicode
   or in virtually any character set if you select the right code page.
- select code page 500 (EBCDIC)

 " Actually some of the fields relate to more than a byte.  For example,
   Unicode and some of the Multibyte character set code pages may
   require more than one byte.  So if you are only one byte from the end
   of file the Unicode field is blank becuase there are not enough bytes.
- move cursor to one byte from the end of file

 " You can also change the value of the current byte in decimal, octal or
   binary.  One cool feature is that you can double-click any of the bits
   in the binary field to toggle them
- change value (decimal) to 255
- dclick all bits until they are mostly zero

~~~~3 FILE PAGE

 " The first 2 pages only relate to the file itself and not the data in
   the file like the other pages.
- switch to File page

 " The File page just shows the name of the file and the directory where it is stored
   along with other filesystem information such as when the file was created,
   last modified and last accessed. This text gives a description of the type
   of file which Windows gets from the registry based on the file extension.
- move mouse over top-right corner (desc field)

 " Like all dialogs in HexEdit you can get more information on a control or field
   by clicking the question mark button in the top right of the dialog then
   clicking the control.
- demo with desc text and Hidden checkbox

~~~~4

 " These flags again are maintained by the Windows filesystem
- move mouse over checkboxes in bottom-right

 " You can find info on them in lots of places but I'll give you a brief explanation:
     RO bit says that the file can't be modified
     hidden bit says that the file is not visible in normal directory listings
     system bit says that this is a system file and you probably should not change it
     the archive bit says that the file has been backed up - this bit is normally
       set by backup software and cleared when the file is modified

 " You can change the Read-only and Hidden bits by right-clicking a file in Explorer
- open HexEdit Explorer and view properties of a file

 " Remember that all this information relates to the file as it exists on disk.
   So even if you have changed the bytes of the file in memory the time of last
   modification won't reflect that until you write the changes to disk.
 " Actually even then if you have "Keep Same Times" turned on then the file times
   won't change.
- show "Keep Same Times" button on standard toolbar

 " You may have noticed that the disk file length is not shown here. It's actually,
   on the Summary page.
- switch to Summary page

~~~~5 SUMMARY

 " There are 2 lengths here: the length on disk and the length of the file as it
   currently exists in the window.  These will be the same unless you have inserted
   or deleted bytes.

 " The 3 main fields of the Summary page let you enter info about the file for your
   own use.  Some people find it handy just to store notes here.
- type a comment

 " The arrow next to the category field lets you select from all existing categories,
   which avoids typoes and having 2 slightly different names for the same category.
- open drop down

 " But you can create a new category on the fly just by typing it in
- enter "Demo" into the category field

 " These fields also have other uses.  For example, you can sort by category
   in the recently opened files dialog and the HexEdit Explorer window.
- open recently opened files dialog and turn on category column and sort by it


~~~~6
 " This info is of course retained when I close the file
- enter a comment close file and reopen it


 " You may be wondering where the Category, Comments etc is stored.  Is it in the registry or perhaps
   in an alternate data stream (like the way Word sometimes stores properties)?
- close the file

 " Actually it is just stored in the recently used file list file.  This is
   where HexEdit stores all the information about files that have been opened
   including formatting, highlights etc.  If you delete the entry for the file
   in the RFL then this information will be lost.
- open RFL remove the file and close
- reopen file to show comments gone in properties dialog
