 " One of the most appreciated features that HexEdit has had since version 2.0
   is full customization of toolbars, keyboards, menus, context menus, etc
 " One reason I am loathe to customize some applications like Visual Studio is
   that as soon as the next version comes out you have to re-do all your
   customizations all over again.  (In VS2010 this is really bad as they have
   rewritten it using WPF and the customization process is extremely tedious.
   You can no longer just drag toolbar buttons around to create your own layout
   but must muck around with dialog and long lists of commands.

- open cust dialog

 " Luckilly, HexEdit customization uses the old, simple drag method.
   What's more when you upgrade to a new version generally your customizations
   will continue to work exactly as before.

 " Let's first look at making a new toolbar then later look at menu and
   keyboard cstomization if we have time.

- switch to Toolbars page
- enable Standard toolbar, Edit Bar

 " You can change the existing toolbars and even drag buttons to the menu bar
   but we will just create a new toolbar and work with that.

- click "New" and call it Andrew
- drag cust dialog down a bit, drag new toolbar above it

 " It is a simple matter to drag a button from another toolbar onto a new toolbar, but this
   *moves* the button. If you want to make a copy then hold down the control key while dragging.
- Ctrl+drag a few buttons to the new toolbar
~~~~~~1

 " You can also drag items from the menu bar. Again you need to hold down the control key
- ctrl+drag "New..." from the File menu

 " to remove a button just drag it off the toolbar
- drag a button off the new toolbar

 " Some commands may not be found on existing toolbars or menus
   For these you can simply drag from the first page.
- switch to "Commands" page, go to "All Commands" category
- find Redraw command and drag to new toolbar

 " Buttons can be displayed as an icons and/or as test.  Generally text is only used
   on menus but some commands have no associated icon, like the Redraw command here.
- right-click "Redraw" and select "Button Appearance"
- select Image Only, and select the paintbrush image
- click OK

  " The Redraw command is now just a button with a paintbrush image.
  " You can even draw your own image
- right-click "Redraw" and select "Button Appearance", select "Edit..." button

  " You can use these simple drawing tools OR you can paste an image you have created
    in a more advanced icon package
- change the drawing, click OK, click OK
~~~~~~2

  " The only other thing that is not clear when you right-click a button
    in customization mode is the meaning of this "Start Group" item
- right-click "Redraw" button to show context menu

  " This simply leaves a space between the button and the previous button.
    When used on a menu it draws a horizontal line between items
	
  " There are few special items you can add to toolbars (and menus)
  " First there are the tools (Find Tool, Jump Tools, Bookmarks Tool) that
    include a drop-down list.  You can place these on toolbars as normal.
- Open Commands page, go to Navigation category
- drag Hex Jump Tool to middle of new toolbar

  " You can resize these tools by simply selecting the tool & dragging the right edge
- resize Hex Jump Tool
~~~~~~3

  " You can also add sub-menus to toolbars and to other menus.
    Here you can see the Mark menu which is already present on the Navigation toolbar
- drag Mark menu to new toolbar

  " You can also create a new menu from scratch using this "New Menu" option
- drag "New Menu" to new toolbar

  " Then you can add items to the new menu
- drag some buttons onto the new menu including Mark Menu

  " You also may want to use a better name for the sub-menu
- right-click and select "Button Appearance"
- enter "Test Menu" into "Button Text" field
  
  " Before I forget, there is a new feature in HeEt 4, the ability to assign macros to buttons.
    To use this you first need to create a keystroke macro and save it to a macro file.
	Then you can a assign it ti a button or keystroke.  Luckilly a keystroke macro is
	included with HeEt
- Open Commands page, go to Macros category (2nd last)
- drag AllChars to new toolbar
~~~~~~4

  " While we're here we'll also have a quick look at keyboard customization.
- switch to Keyboard page

  " These are also sometimes called "accelerators". We have only one set of acceleartors called Default
- show accelerators drop-down list

  " On this page all the commands are grouped into categories again
- click Category drop-down, and select Edit

  " If you choose a command you can see which keys (if any) it is assigned to
- select "Cut" command

  " Here we can see that Cut is assigned to Ctrl+X and Shift-Delete
  " To remove a key assignement just select it and click the Remove button
- select Shift+Delete and click Remove

  " To add a new keyboard shortcut you need to select the command first
- select Category:Macros, then select Macro:AllChars

  " No you enter the keystroke to assign here
- Type Ctrl+A in the "Press New Shortcut Key" field

  " You can see that Ctrl+A is already assigned to "select all"
- Type Ctrl+Alt+A

  "  Ctrl+Alt+A is unassigned so we can use that
- click Assign button

  " I still haven't covered Tools, Context Menus and Double-click events.
    That will have to wait for the next video.
