----------------

Make sure using the latest version
Set ruler options - hex:4,1  dec:5,10
Turn off mouse/cursor in ruler option
open HexEdit.exe - reset file options: turn off addresses start at 1, group:4
Turn off Format Bar

----------------

 " The ruler is very useful for working with columns.
   It's a global option which you can toggle using the View menu ...
- turn off using View/Ruler
 " or there's a button on the Format bar which I will open now
- open Format Bar
 " This button toggles the ruler for all windows, ...
- zoom on ruler button on Format Bar

 " but how it looks for a particular file can depend on your 
   current file's display options. For example, you can have different
   ruler settings for separate hex and decimal rulers.  The ruler that
   is displayed depends upon whether addresses are shown in decimal or hex.
- switch between decimal and hex addresses
- leave displaying decimal addresses/ruler

 " There are always these small lines called ticks between columns but you can set
   how often the larger ticks are displayed and how often numbers are displayed
   in the options dialog.
- open Options dialog to Workspace/Display page

~~~~ 1

 " I'll just go to the Workspace/Display page
- change decimal ruler ticks to 3 and click Apply

 " You can also adjust how often numbers are displayed
- change decimal numbers to 5 click Apply

 " If numbers are displayed for every column then only
   a single digit is displayed at the top of each column
- change decimal numbers to 1, click Apply

 " The offsets are all zero-based so you can work out the address
   of a byte by adding its column number to the address on the left.
- move mouse over column and address values

 " This is useful for people who are used to working with zero-based
   systems such as C and assmebler programmers. I don't understand
   it but some people prefer 1-based addresses.  This is an option you
   can set in the file options page.
~~~~ 2

 " I can use this button to quickly jump to the document display options page
- jump to doc display options page
- turn on addresses start at 1 option and click Apply

 " While I am here I may as well switch to hex addresses so we
   can try the hex ruler
- turn on hex addresses and click Apply
- turn off "addresses start at 1"
- switch back to the global display options page
 " For example, a tidy display for the hex ruler uses column grouping of 4,
   large ticks every 8 and numbers every 16.
- set numbers every 16, ticks every 8
~~~~ 3

 " Another option for the ruler is the display of the current cursor and mouse 
   position in the ruler.  Actually this option also turns on the
   same display in the address bar (even if the ruler is off).
- turn both options on and click OK
- move the mouse out of the way and move the cursor around
- move the mouse around

 " Finally the ruler has these handles (which are similar to what I think are called "markers" in
   Word ruler) which allow you to very easily adjust some of the display settings.
- zoom in on the grouping marker

 " If you just hold the mouse over the marker a tip window shows the current
   value.  This is very useful when working with fixed size records
   to check that the number of columns is correct.
~~~~ 4

 " The columns handle is red if autofit is on
- turn on autofit
- zoom on columns handle

 " but you can still drag it to resize
- drag handle to reduce columns


 " Of course, undo works with all these options as usual
- undo to get back autofit mode

 " You can drag the offset handle right to increase the offset
- move to start of file and drag offset right

 " Or you can drag left whence it wraps around to the end of line
- drag offset handle left

 " One final note is that all the colours used in the ruler are settable
   in the current colour scheme.  I will explain colour schemes in the next video.
