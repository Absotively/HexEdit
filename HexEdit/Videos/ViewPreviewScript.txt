switch to Summary Properties page and close Properties dialog
save splash.pdn as splash.png with transparent bg
open splash.png, turn off preview view and close again
make sure default open folder is HexEdit data folder
delete ToolbarImages.bmp from RFL (leave splash.PNG)

 " Preview is a new feature in HexEdit 5 which allows you to view
   a bitmap file such as JPEG or PNG. You can even edit the bytes
   of the file in memory to see what effect it has on the image.
- Open file from HexEdit data directory, turn on Image filter (*.bmp,...) and open ToolbarImages.bmp
- turn on preview view (split window)

 " This is the preview of the BMP file.
   You can scroll the view using the mouse wheel - hold shift key to scroll horizontally
- demo
   Or you can just click and drag.
-demo
   You can zoom by holding down the Ctrl key and rotating the mouse wheel
- demo
   If you don't like the direction of the zoom you can reverse it using the setting
   in Options/Workspace/Editing/Invert Ctrl+Wheel zoom
- demo change setting
   To zoom to actual size just use the menu item
- demo

 " The really cool feature of the preview view is that you can modify the file's
   bytes directly in HexEdit to see what effect it might have
- select a large block of bytes near the end of the file and select Op/NOT
 " I just inverted all the bits there, if I invert again you will get the old image back
- Op/NOT
 "Of course, you can undo any change
- select Edit/Undo then again
 " HexEdit includes templates for common image file formats such as BMP and PNG.
   You can open a template to easily see and change settings
- open BMP template, turn on DATA column
- expand info_hdr, and check bitcount (should be 4)
 " From this we can see that each pixel of the bitmap uses 4 bits
   which gives 16 colours which we can see in the palette table
- expand colours table to show 16 entries (0 to 15)
 " Looking at the hex data we can see that a lot of nybbles have the value "7"
 " If we open colour 7 in the palette we can see that it is a light grey
- change R,G,B from 192 to 0
 " Here we have changed the background colour from light grey to black

 " The preview supports all bit depths including transparency.
   For example, if we open a 32-bit PNG file with an alpha channel ...
- open Recent file list
 " You can see all files of a certain type that you have already opened
   using the Type column of the recent file dialog
- turn on "Type" column and click it to sort by Type, scroll to PNG files
- open Splash.PNG
 " You can easily see the transparent and semi-transparent pixels using
   the checkerboard background
- zoom in on an edge
 " Or you can try a black or white background
- switch to white
 " The standard background is the standard Windows colour for buttons
   and will change when you change your Windows theme
- switch to std

 " In the future HexEdit will be extended to support preview of other file types
 
 " Currently it supports just about all bitmap image formats including BMP,
   PNG, GIF, TIFF, JPEG etc.  It does not use the file extension to detect
   the file type. If you want to check the file type you can open the Bitmap
   Properties page
- right click and select properties and go to bitmap properties page

 " This shows info about the data as it was on disk and as it currently is in memory
   These will be the same unless you start changing some of the header values like bitcount
- go to template and change the bitcount from 4 to 8

 " Here you can see that the bit depth in memory is 8 but on disk it is 4.
   If we saved the file now then they would both become 8
