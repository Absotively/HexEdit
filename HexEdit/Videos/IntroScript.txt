remove edited file _bmp.xml from recent file list
turn on just standard toolbar
turn off mouse/cursor in ruler
turn off info tips
Use file Open dialog to change dir to HexEdit directory.
Adjust position of help window.
---------------------------
  " This is the first of many videos to help you get the most out of HexEdit.
    I will demonstrate using HexEdit 3.5 but generally you can use
    any version including the free version.

  " I will assume you know some basics such as what bits and bytes are and
    the type of information that a file can contain, but if not you can read
    the excellent introduction to binary files in the help.
- open help and click a few "All ABout Binary Files" pages

  " I'll just open any file now to demonstrate a few features.
    I'll just go into the HexEdit directory where there are a lot of XML files
    and select _BMP.XML and I'll open it read only so I don't accidentally change anything.
- Open _bmp.xml - read-only

  " Now this is an XML file which is just a plain text file.  So we can
    just as easily edit it in a text editor like NotePad, but you can use
    a hex editor to view and edit any type of file not just text files.
    Files that aren't text files are often called binary files
    since each byte can contain any combination of bits not just
    text characters. Hex editors are often called binary file editors.

  " This is a typical binary editor display where the addresses are on the left,
    hex values in the middle, and the corresponding text characters on the right.

  " The first byte of the file is highlighted in light blue - this is called
    the "mark" and is very useful but we will talk about the mark later.

  " If you have ever used any other sort of editor then the mouse and keyboard should
    work as you expect.  You can move the cursor around using the arrow keys, Page Up
    and Down etc.  Home moves to the start of line, End moves to the End. Ctrl+Home takes
    you to the start of file and Ctrl+End takes you to the end.
- demo keys

  " Holding the control key and using the arrow keys moves by groups.
- demo

  " The tab key flips between the hex and character areas as in most hex editors

  " Note that as you move the cursor in one area there is a shadow
    cursor in the other area showing the corresponding byte.

  " You can select a block of bytes by holding down the SHIFT key
    and using the cursor keys.
demo

  " Of course you can simply select using the mouse, including autoscroll etc
demo
  " but I'll talk more about selecting later

  " You can change this default display in many ways.  For example you can
    select from the Show Area drop down list to view just hex or characters.
- Switch to hex and then char modes

  " It's a good idea to also turn on autofit so you see as much as possible on the screen
- Turn on autofit and resize the window

- Switch to stacked mode
  " The other display mode is called stacked mode which is like character mode but
    underneath each character are the 2 corresponding hex digits.

- switch to hex mode
  " You always want to see the data as hex but sometimes you want to see
    the file addresses in decimal.  This button toggles between hex and
    decimal addresses.  Note that all addresses start at zero like all hex editors
    but there is is an option to change that.

  " That's just a brief introduction to using HexEdit.  In the next demo we will see
    how to change the display according top your preferences or the task at hand.
