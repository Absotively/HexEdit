 " In this video we will explore how bookmarks integrate with other features of HexEdit.
 " But first we will look at a few things I forgot to mention in the previous bookmarks video
- open bookmarks window

 " First you can simply double-click a bookmark in order to open the file it is in
- dclick a couple of bookmarks

 " Another recent feature is the ability to simply move bookmarks by dragging.
   I don't know about you but I am always finding bookmarks slightly out of position for
   various reasons. It used to be tedious to move a bookmark - now you can just drag it.
- demonstrate dragging a bookmark

 " All bookmarks are stored in a disk file.  Deleting this file will clear all your bookmarks.
- find the file in HexEdit Explorer

 " Of course, it's probably easier just to select all the bookmarks and delete them.
 " You might do this if you use a shared computer and are worried about privacy.
- select all bookmarks in bookmarks window

 " A simple way to delete all bookmarks automatically when you close the program is
   to use the History page of the Options dialog
- open Options dialog, goto History Lists/Clear all bookmarks
~~~~~~1

 " While we have the Options dialog open I will show how to change the colour used
   for bookmarks in the current clour scheme

- goto Document/Colour Schemes
- select Bookmarks colour (4th) and change it to red
- click Apply
- change to Automatic and click OK

 " Another option is if you hold the mouse over a bookmark you can see a tip window
   that shows its name.
- hold mouse over bookmark
  
 " As long as you have the bookmarks checkbox on in the Info Tips options page
- Tools/Options/Workspace/Info Tips
- click checkbox off then on

 " There is also a context menu for bookmarks that appears when you right click any bookmark.
   You can customize this menu just like the other context menus.
- Tools/Customize/Menu/Context/Bookmarks
- drag Cust dialog to left, drag Bookmarks menu to right

 " I'll just add a command to display the Aerial View to the menu since that is what 
   I want to show next
- go to Commands page
- drag Aerial/Split Aerial View to Bookmarks menu
- Close

 " Now if I right-click a bookmark you can see the new menu
- right-click and select Aerial View
- close Bookmarks window
~~~~ 2

 " Now this is the Aerial view of the file which if you don't know gives an overview of
   a file using a single pixel for each byte.  It is more useful with the rainbow colour
   scheme
- select Rainbow colour scheme

 " You can see many things in the Aerial view, including bookmarks, 
   either in the border and/or as marching ants
- turn off ants for selection
- add bookmarks and scroll the aerial view to show them

 " I'm not sure if this video will show the marching ants.  It may be better if I zoom.
- zoom Aerial view

 " You can also see indicators in the left border.
- turn on Bookmarks in border
- move mouse over them   

 " Being able to quickly locate all the bookmarks in a file using the Aerial view
   is very useful.  For example you might have bookmarked all occurrences
   of some search text.  Why don't I show that now.
~~~~ 3

 " Bookmarking all found search occurrences is very useful when you need to
   retain the results of multiple searches.  This happens a lot.
- open Find dialog, go to Text page,

 " I know this file contains lots of less than characters so I am just going to
   search for that using the text search page, with the whole file option
- enter < in text to search for, select "whole file"

 " We use this "Bookmark all" button but first I will add a prefix for my bookmark names
   so I remember what they were for
- enter prefix of "LessThan"
- click "Bookmark All" button

 " Bookmarks can also be used in the Find tools and in the Calculator.  For example, you
   can use them in an expression to calculate an address to jump to.
   But only bookmarks of the active file can be used in this way.
- Enter "start + 10" into the decimal jump tool and press Enter

 " Finally bookmarks are particularly useful in keystroke macros.  You can use them to
   remember a position and return to it later even in a different file or a file
   that is not even open.
