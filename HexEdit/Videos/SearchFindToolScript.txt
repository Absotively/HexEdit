-------------------------
 " Now we will just have a quick look at the Find Tool.
   This is a drop down list that is, by default, on the Edit Bar.
- open Edit Bar

 " To quickly do a hex search type in some hex digits and press Enter
- Enter "0D0A" and press Enter

 " The next occurrence is now highlighted.
   (Just ignore the other green-highlighted occurrences for now.)

 " If I want to search for some text I precede the string with a equals sign (=)
- Enter "=TYPE" and press Enter

 " Or I can do a case-insensitive search by using a tilde (~)
- Enter "~TYPE" and press Enter

 " Remember to start the search you must press Enter,
   but if you chnage your mind you can just press Escape.
- Enter xx and press Esc

 " After you perform a search it is saved in the history list.
   You can select a previous search from the list and either edit it OR
   just press Enter to search for it again.
- select "0D0A" from the list and press Enter
~~~~~~1

 " I guess I should explain the green highlights now.  Whenever you perform a search
   HexEdit fires up background processes to look for all other occurrences of the text.
   Though this is controlled by an option and you might have to turn it one to see them.
- Tools/Options/Workspace/Background Process/Searching
   
  " You can see there are 148 occurrences in this file from the count in the status bar
- hover over status bar

  " You can go to the next occurrence by pressing F3 or using the 3rd button on the Edit Bar
- click button a few times

  " Press SF3 to repeat a search but going backwards.
  " Notice that the current occurrence is also shown in the status bar
- hover over status bar

  " Sometimes the display can be annoying so I often just search for something that won't be 
    found to clear it
- Enter "~~~~~~~" in the Find Tool and press Enter
~~~~~~2

  " HexEdit is very good for working with big files.  In a large file a search can take
    a long time so HexEdit displays a progress bar
- open big file and search for something that won't be found

  " You'll also notice that the jump tools update to show the current search address
    Also you can abort a search at any time by pressing Escape or the Space-Bar
	
  " One more thing I should mention is that when doing a text search the actual bytes
    searched for will, of course, depend on the current character set
- switch to EBCDIC (View/Char Set/EBCDIC), type "<" in Find Tool and press Enter

  " Also not that if you delete the equals sign (=) in the Find Tool then the text
    is convered to the corresponding hex digits using the current character set
	
- del = in "=<" in EBCDIC to get "4C"
- put back "="
- switch to ASCII (View/Char Set/ASCII)
- del = in "=<" to get "3C"

  " So you can actually use the Find Tool to convert between ASCII and EBCDIC
    Suppose you have a byte with value 85 which you know is an EBCDIC character
- put "65" into Find Tool (ASCII mode)
- switch to EBCDIC (View/Char Set/EBCDIC)
- add "=" at start of find tool to get "=e"

  " We can now see that 85 corresponds to a lower-case E in EBCDIC
- switch to ASCII (View/Char Set/ASCII)
- del = in "=<" to get "65"

  " Which is 65 in ASCII
  
  " That's about it for the Find Tool, but you can do even more powerful things
    using the Find dialog
  " One good thing is that it shares the same text and hex histories as the Find Tool
- open find dialog and switch to hex page (shows 65)
- open history
- switch to text page (shows e)
- open history

  " I will talk a lot more about the Find Dialog in the next videos.
