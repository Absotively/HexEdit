 " In this video we are going to look at Jump Lists which are a cool feature added
   in Windows 7 which allows you to right-click an program in the task bar
   to quickly perform common tasks.
- right-Click EverNote icon to see its Jump Lists

 " For HexEdit you can quickly open the last file you used
- right-click HexEdit icons to see Fav/Freq/Recent files
 " OR files you open a lot even if you haven't opened them in a while
- mouse over Frequent Files
 " OR files you have tagged as favourites in HexEdit
- mouse over Favourites

 " So how do you tag a file as a favourite?
- select a file to open it in HexEdit

 " The simplest way is to click the "star" icon on the main toolbar
- click "star" on Standard toolbar

 " Behind the scenes this is simply adding the currently open file to the "Favourites" category
 
 " The favourites category and the star button has been in HexEdit since before Windows
   7 but now it is used to populate the "Favourites" Jump List

 " To change the category of a file you can simply open the Properties dialog
- open Prop dialog, switch to Summary page
- open another file, switch between the files to see the Category change

 " To change the category just select it from the drop down list
- change 2nd file from TBD to Favourites

 " Or you can type in a new category
- type in category of "New"

 " You can also see categories in the Explorer window
- open HexEdit Explorer window right

 " You need to turn on the Categories column
- right-click a column header and select Categories
- turn off Size and Modified columns

 " So if I wanted to open all files in the "Bad" category I can just sort them
- click the Category column header and select all in the "Bad" category

 " and open them right from HexEdit Explorer
- right-click and select "open read-only", then change category of some to "New"

 " OK so that is how categories work. Now we go back to Jump Lists.
- close HexEdit

 " The next time you open HexEdit it will add the Favourites to your Jump Lists
- open HexEdit
- it should display the "Admin Provileges" dialog

 " Ah, now this is a complication. For Jump Lists to work the files in the Jump List
   must have been registered with Windows as openable by HexEdit. This is not a problem
   with most programs since they can usually only open there own types of files.
   For example, when you install Word the installer automatically says that .DOC and .DOCX
   file are openable with Word.
   
 " Of course, you can open any sort of file with HexEdit. After all it is designed to be
   able to edit any type of binary file. But to add the files to the HexEdit Jump Lists
   HexEdit has to chnage some global registry settings.
   
 " Now Windows won't allow a program to ordinarily change settings for all users even
   if the person running the program is an admin. To do this you must start a program with
   Admin privileges. So HexEdit has to fire up a special program to modify the registry
   settings. When this program is run you will see the good old UAC prompt.
- click "yes" and the UAC window is shown

 " You also have to click Yes here for Jump Lists to work
- click "Yes" and close HexEdit

 " Now the Jump Lists have been set up
- right-click HexEdit icon and select a Favourite file
