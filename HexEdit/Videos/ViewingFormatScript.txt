Remove hexedit.exe from RFL

----------------------------
  " In this video we will look at a few commands that change the layout of the HexEdit display.
    First I'll just open a file so I can demonstrate.

- open hexedit.exe
  " Many of these options are on a separate toolbar called the Format Bar -
    so I'll just turn that on by right clicking the menu bar and selecting it.

- open format toolbar

  " First, the ruler is a very useful facility that shows the columns in hex or decimal
    depending on how addresses are currently displayed.  It also allows you to adjust
    the layout in various ways which I will demonstrate later.
- turn ruler on
- toggle address display

  " You already saw the auto-fit button
- turn on autofit and resize

  " If you turn off autofit you can also adjust the number of columns using these buttons
- turn off auto-fit
- demo dec/inc columns

  " The font drop downs allow you to quickly select a new font or font size
- demo font and size

  " We saw these other commands in the previous video but they are 
   in the Format Bar on separate buttons here for ease of use.
- change to hex mode ...
  " Or to make things even easier you can move a button to your own toolbar.  For example, if 
  " you use stacked mode and EBCDIC a lot (as I know certain of you do)
    you can drag these buttons to another toolbar
  " Actually it is very easy to change the toolbars by holding down the Alt key and dragging
    a button.  If you also hold down the Control key you will copy a button instead of moving it

- copy stacked and EBCDIC buttons to the menu bar

  " All of these formating options and many more can be changed in the Options dialog.
- Open Options dialog - switch to doc/general page
- general page
  " All the option pages under "Document" relate to the file you are working on.
  " This button restores the default settings and this button saves the current
    settings as the default.

- display page
  " The display page has most of the options we have already seen on the toolbars,
    here is autofit, area display, char set and controls chars
- toggle autofit
- change area display
- change char set

  " But there are a few things you can do here that you can't with the toolbar buttons.
    For example you can display line numbers and you can turn on both hex and decimal
    addresses at the same time.
- turn on line nos and click Apply

  " If I change the options and click the Apply button I can see the effect in the window.
- turn on hex and decimal addresses and click Apply
- move dialog up so effect can be seen

  " The grouping option says how columns are grouped
- chnage grouping and click Apply

  " The offset option is not often used but was requested by several people.
    It just says at what column the first byte of the file is displayed.
- change offset and click Apply

    One use for the offset is when you have a file which consists of many fixed sized records
    preceded by a header of a different length.  There are several database formats like this.
    You adjust the offset so the first record starts at the left column and you set the number
    of columns to match the record size.

- close Options dialog

  " Another way to adjust the offset is just to position the cursor at the column
    which you want on the left side of the screen and press Alt+Enter.

- move mouse and click Alt-Enter

  " In the next video we will look at how to make a selection of some bytes of the file.
