 " This time we are going to look at the highlighter which was one of the first features I added
   to HexEdit.  I got the idea when I saw the highlighter in Microsoft Word about 15 years ago.
   The HexEdit highlighter works very much like the Word one.
- highlight a few bytes using the menu item

 " The highlighter is available in the Edit menu or on the Edit Bar
- show edit bar
+ zoom on button

 " Like Word there are 2 ways to highlight - either select what you want to highlight
   and click the highlighter button
- select then highlight

 " OR turn on highlight mode whence everything you select is automatically highlighted.
- turn on highlighter mode and do some selecting

 " You can also SUBTRACT from the higlighted bytes - if everything you selected 
   is already highlighted then they are unhighlighted.
- demo subtracting
 " This can be useful if you want to highlight a large block but with a few holes in it.
- demo large highlight + some holes

~~~~ 1

- make sure there are at least 3 highlights for following ...
 " The 2 buttons on the Edit bar are to higlight as we saw and to remove all 
   highlights from the file.  Undo as always is fully supported.
- show remove all and undo

   There are more options for the highlighter in the drop-down menu on the Format Bar.

- show format bar
+ zoom on drop down list
 " You can jump to the next and previous highlighted sections

- go to next and previous highlights using buttons
 " You can also use the Ctrl+Alt+P and Ctrl+Alt+N to move between them
- next and previous highlights using keys

 " You can also hide the highlights without actually deleting them.
   Someone asked for this feature as they sometimes found them visually
   distracting.  However, it can be very confusing if you have turned them
   off by accident or forgot that you did so.
- turn off highlights
- use menu to go to next highlight
- turn on again

 " I recommend never using the hide feature.  If you find the highlights distracting
   you can change the colour in the current colour scheme to something less bright.

 " Just open the options dialog to the colour scheme page
- open options dialog - colour scheme page
 " You can select any colour you want
- select "Other" option from drop down and show standard and custom pages
- select a light yellow

 " The highlighter does more than than just let you mark bytes of a file.
   It is used in many places as a discontiguous selection.  For example,
   it is used for discontiguous export to Motorola-S and Intel-Hex files.
- open Motorola-S export dialog
+ zoom on checkbox
 " Similarly you can highlight imported parts of a file
- open Motorola import dialog
+ zoom on highlight checkbox

 " The highlighter is also very useful when comparing files
- Open another .xml file and split horizontally
 " If you turn the highlighter on then whenever a difference is found
   the different bytes are highlighted.
- use tools Compare Windows menu item
 " If you hold down Alt+C then all the differences are highlighted


 " Another useful capability is the highlighter context menu.
   When you right-click any highlighted byte you will see a context menu
- demonstrate
 " If you work a lot with the highlighter you can even customise this menu
- demonstrate adding select highlight to the menu

 " One thing to watch is that there is also a selection context menu that
   takes precedence over the highlighter context menu.
   If you right click a hihglighted byte that is already selected then
   you see the selection context menu
- demonstrate

 " Of course if you close a file and reopen it your highlights are retained
- close _bmp.xml and reopen
 " The highlight information is stored in HexEdit's so called "recent file list"
   It will be remembered forever, and separately for each user.
   Of course, if you remove the file from the recent file list you will lose
   all your highlights along with other formatting information.
- close _bmp.xml and remove it from the RFL

 " One final, very nice, feature that was added in HexEdit 3.5 in the aerial view.
   The aerial view gives you an overview of the file.
- turn on aerial view in a split window
   Part of that overview might be to see which bytes are highlighted.
   You can very easily see which parts of the file are highlighted in the aerial
   view as it is shown in the border and using marching ants

- use context menu to ensure that highlights are shown in border and as ants
+ zoom to show the border and ants
 " I am not sure if you can see the animated marhcing ants as the frame rate
   for this video is very low.

- remove highlights
- close file
