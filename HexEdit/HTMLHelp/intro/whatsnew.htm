<h2><font style="font-family: Arial;"
			face=Arial>What’s New in 4.0</font></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This version of HexEdit has been renamed to <span class=HexEdit>HexEdit 
 Pro 4.0</span>. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->It 
 contains a new, improved user interface and many other significant features.</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">User Interface</span></h3>

<p>The major change to the user interface is the use of the new docking 
 system first seen in Visual Studio but now common in other applications. 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<span class=HexEdit><!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->HexEdit 
 Pro</span> has always had several dockable windows (Bookmarks etc) that 
 have always been able to be docked to the side of the window, moved to 
 another part of the display such as a second monitor, or just &quot;float&quot; 
 on top of the main HexEdit window. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->These 
 were previously called modeless dialogs, and dialog bars but are now called 
 <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Tool Windows</span>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tool Windows are still dockable and floatable, but can now be docked 
 on top of each other, whence tabs appear to select between them. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Moreover, 
 a tool window can be docked to the side of another tool window, and docking 
 positions are much more flexible with visible indicators of the new position. 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->They can 
 also be <span style="font-style: italic;">auto-hide</span>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, many of the nice features of the old system have been moved 
 to the new system such as the ability of <span style="font-style: italic;">floating</span> 
 tool windows to move out of the way when covering the current cursor position. 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->There is 
 an option to turn this off if you don't like it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were also many other user interface improvements such as the Properties 
 window being resizeable and being able to select the overall look of the 
 application from the <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Application 
 Look</span> sub-menu of the <span style="font-style: italic;">View</span> 
 menu.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further all simple dialogs that display a message or ask a simple question 
 have been replaced with Windows 7 style information dialogs. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Many 
 of these dialogs also have a checkbox to say &quot;Do not tell me again&quot; 
 or &quot;Do not ask me again&quot;. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->There 
 is a new option to reset all these settings so the message/question boxes 
 are seen once more..</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other new features include</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>assign a keystroke macro to a keyboard shortcut, 
 toolbar button, or menu item</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>move a bookmark simply by clicking and dragging</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>current byte used by the popup &quot;tip&quot; 
 window has a rectangle around it in the hex and character areas</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Code Pages</span></h3>

<p>In addition to the existing character display options (ASCII, EBCDIC, 
 etc) you can also select to display according to any of the installed 
 Windows code pages. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->This 
 includes UTF-8, and many EBCDIC, Macintosh etc code pages.</p>

<h3><span>Calculator</span></h3>

<p>Extensive improvements have been made to the Calculator including:.</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>improved resizing behavior</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>support for use of any integer radix (not just 
 1,8,10,16) up to 36</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>support for signed/unsigned numbers in any radix</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>support for any size of integer arithmetic (not 
 just 8, 16, 32 and 64)</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>arithmetic with infinite precision integers (signed 
 or unsigned)</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>visual display of the bottom 64 bits of the current 
 integer [below value display] - click any bit to toggle it</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>the full expression that is being calculated is 
 displayed [above value display] including brackets to show order of evaluation</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>all calculations that have been performed are 
 available from the drop-down history</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>history list also shows the calculated result 
 for any item in a &quot;tip&quot; window</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Installer</h3>

<p>A new installer is now used which gives more reliable installations 
 and new features. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->When 
 uninstalling you have the option of keeping or removing all settings.</p>

<h3><span>Commands</span></h3>

<p>Several new built-in CRC and message digest (SHA) commands have been 
 added. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->There 
 is also general purpose CRC generator that allows generation of CRC according 
 to several parameters (truncated polynomial etc) - not that this is a 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">beta</span> feature as it is not yet 
 integrated with keystroke macros or documented in the help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other new commands are &quot;Close Others&quot; and several that change 
 the application look,</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Templates</span></h3>

<p>One interesting features that was recently requested was the ability 
 to assign a color to a template field so that the corresponding bytes 
 in the hex area are highlighted in the selected color.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The C/C++ parser was enhanced to be compatible with the latest C standard. 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->In particular, 
 variadic macros are now supported.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were also several enhancements to <span class=HexEdit>HexEdit 
 Pro</span>'s built-in expressions (see below). <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->(Expressions 
 can be used in the calculator, jump tools etc but are mainly used in templates.)</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Expressions</span></h3>

<p>The sizeof(), defined() and string() functions now work on built-in 
 variables. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->(Previously 
 they only worked on template fields.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Date expressions have been improved in several ways. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->First 
 date differences return a value of FLOAT type rather than DATE type - 
 this avoids some ambiguous situations caused by dates and date-differences 
 both being stored in variables of DATE type. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->(We 
 could have invented a new &quot;date difference&quot; type but a FLOAT 
 that simply stores the number of days between two dates is just as effective.)</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Options</span></h3>

<p>There are many new options:</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">clipboard</span>: 
 4 new options for how binary data is copied and pasted (including the 
 often requested &quot;hex text&quot;)</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>calculate <span style="font-weight: bold;">statistics</span> 
 (byte counts, CRCs etc) in a low-priority background thread (also see 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Properties</span> below)</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>new options to not do background processing (search 
 and statistics) for files on the network or on removable media</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>print a <span style="font-weight: bold;">watermark</span> 
 behind all pages (including same options as header/footer for date etc)</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>different <span style="font-weight: bold;">first 
 page</span> options for both headers and footers</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>six new options to turn on/off printing of bookmarks, 
 highlights etc</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>swap left/right headers and footers on alternating 
 pages (usually used with double-sided printing)</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>several options for the default open and save-as 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">directories</span></p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>option to occasionally check for the availability 
 of updates</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Properties</h3>

<p>The Properties dialog is now resizable with many fields expanding to 
 fill the space when it is enlarged.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two new pages have been added to support the new background statistics 
 options. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->One 
 page shows a graph of the byte count for all 256 byte values using the 
 current color scheme. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Another 
 page displays background values selected to be calculated such as CRCs 
 of the file.</p>
