<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The address area on the left of the window shows where in the file the 
 displayed bytes are from (in either hex or decimal). <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->You 
 can also see the location of the cursor within the file in the Decimal 
 and Hex Address Tools in the Edit Bar. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The 
 cursor may not be within the display (for example if you have used the 
 scrollbars) but once you use any of the cursor movement keys the displays 
 scrolls so that the cursor is displayed. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Or 
 you can click within the display to move the cursor to the byte clicked 
 on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The normal cursor movement keys (arrow keys, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pg 
 Up</span> etc) are supported for moving the cursor. As with most MSDOS/Windows 
 software, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Home</span> key moves to 
 the first byte on the line, <span style="font-weight: bold;">End</span> 
 moves to the last. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ctrl+Home</span> and 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ctrl+End</span> move to the start and 
 end of the file. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ctrl+Left</span> and 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ctrl+Right</span> move left and right 
 by a whole group of columns. You can edit the file either in the hex or 
 the character area – to quickly flip between the areas use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tab</span> 
 key.</p>

<p class=footnote-text
	style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The scroll bars allow you to move the current display without changing 
 the cursor position. For a large file the vertical scroll bar (on the 
 right side of the window) is particularly useful. Clicking the arrows 
 at the end of the scroll bar (or using the default Ctrl+U or Ctrl+D keyboard 
 shortcuts) moves by one line. Clicking in the scroll bar but above or 
 below the scroll box moves by a page. You can also drag the box to a position 
 anywhere within the file. (Note that the size of the box, in proportion 
 to the size of the entire scroll bar, reflects the amount of the file 
 that is visible within the window – if the entire file is visible then 
 the scroll bar will disappear.) The Ctrl+L (in default keymap) keyboard 
 shortcut scrolls the display so that the cursor is positioned in the middle 
 of the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Jumping to an Address</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>A simple way to move to a distant address is to drag the scroll box 
 until the address you want is visible and click within the display to 
 set the cursor location. However, for very large files the scroll bar 
 resolution may mean that you can’t drag to the exact position but may 
 have to use the Page Up or Page Down keys as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alternatively, the Decimal and Hex Address Tools in the Edit Bar allow 
 you to jump quickly to a known address within the file. (Note that, as 
 is sensible and conventional in binary file editors, the “first” byte 
 of the file has an address of zero.) <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->As 
 you type an address in one tool the corresponding address is updated in 
 the other – as a useful side effect, this provides a simple way to convert 
 between hex and decimal numbers. These tools also display the current 
 address as you move the cursor around the screen and during searches and 
 file comparisons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both of these tools also store separate histories of the last addresses 
 jumped to, which can be selected from the drop down list. Note that you 
 have to press the Enter key to actually jump to the address and return 
 to the edit window. You can use the Tab and Shift+Tab keys to quickly 
 flip between these two controls without returning to the edit window.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>New in version 2.5 is the ability to enter an expression into the hex 
 and decimal address tools. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The 
 syntax and operators for expressions are almost identical to that used 
 in C/C++. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->You 
 can even assign to variables (eg &quot;reclen=10&quot;) and use those 
 variables and bookmarks (see below) of the current file to calculate an 
 expression (eg &quot;base+reclen*5&quot;). <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->See 
 <a HREF="..\overviewadvanced\Expressions.htm">Expressions</a> for more 
 information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can also quickly jump to any bookmark in the current file by selecting 
 it from the &quot;Bookmarks&quot; drop-down list which appears on the 
 navigation bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another powerful (but still fairly easy) way to jump to an address is 
 to use the calculator. If you invoke the calculator using the Edit/GoTo 
 menu item then the current address is loaded into the calculator. You 
 can then type in a new absolute address and click the “GO” button or just 
 press the Enter key to jump to the address. To jump to a relative address 
 click the “+” or “-“ button or press the “+” or “-“ key and type a relative 
 offset and press Enter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Mark, Bookmarks and Highlights</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>A way to return to a previous address is to mark that address with the 
 Mark Position command and later return to it using the Go To Mark command. 
 The <span style="font-weight: bold;">mark</span> is also useful for measuring 
 distances between points in the file. There are decimal and hex “Distance 
 to Mark” indicators in the status bar that show the distance from the 
 mark to the current cursor position.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can also set global bookmarks that associate a name with a file 
 and address. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->You 
 can use the modeless Bookmarks dialog to add bookmarks, sort them, jump 
 to them etc. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->As 
 you move around a file you can also see the closest bookmark above in 
 the Bookmark tool, which can also be used to jump to any bookmark in the 
 file.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another way to remember addresses is to highlight them. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Highlights 
 are sort of like unnamed bookmarks but are much easier to add -- just 
 turn on the highlighter and any selections you make are automatically 
 highlighted. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->By 
 default highlights have a background of yellow (bookmarks are blue) but 
 you can change these colours in the Colours page of the Options dialog.</p>
