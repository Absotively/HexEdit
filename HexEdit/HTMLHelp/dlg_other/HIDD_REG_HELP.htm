 style="margin-left: 18.00pt;"><!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->You must still 
 provide payment through regular mail or our web site (see Methods of Payment 
 below for more information). Please do not send credit card numbers in 
 email, as this is insecure.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Help</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">The Help button brings up this help page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cost</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">You may purchase a single-user license 
 (license) for $40 (US dollars). You may not use a single-user license 
 to run multiple copies of HexEdit on different machines simultaneously. 
 For this, site (multi-user) licenses are available at a per-user discount 
 upon request. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->However, 
 a single person may run HexEdit on different machines at different times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What You 
 Get</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">Purchasing a licence (license) entitles 
 you to free support and upgrades for at least 2 years. It also means that 
 if you want a specific enhancement, it will be given priority over my 
 own ideas and those of unregistered users. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->We 
 have a history of implementing user requests.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">And (this may sound like the standard 
 shareware pitch :-) by buying the product you will make it better, since 
 I can put more time into improving it. I promise that all sales are put 
 back into development and not into a new sportscar.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">HexEdit 1.0 was released as freeware and 
 had an overwhelmingly positive response. Unfortunately due to work and 
 family commitments I have been able to do very little work on it for almost 
 18 months. So in order to justify the time spent on the numerous requested 
 enhancements (and my own ideas for enhancements), I have found it necessary 
 to release new versions as shareware.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">If you really cannot afford to pay for 
 it we release earlier versions as freeware.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">There really are some interesting possible 
 enhancements in the pipeline. For example, I have had an idea, since the 
 inception of HexEdit, for a sort of “aerial view” of a binary file – in 
 fact the color coding of different byte values in version 1.0 was the 
 first step in implementing this. I believe this would give a nice overview 
 of large files and allow much easier detection of irregularities and important 
 sections in many types of files. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<span 
 style="margin-left: 18.00pt;"><!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->By buying the 
 product you may make these sorts of enhancements a reality.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Methods 
 of Payment</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">You can pay by credit card at our <a href="http://www.hexedit.com/register.htm">registration 
 web page</a> at Digital Candle, or send us a cheque (check) in the mail.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">Digital Candle is a dedicated third party 
 site set up to handle credit card transaction over the web. This facility 
 is very convenient and totally secure. Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Web 
 Site</span> button to go to the on-line HexEdit registration page in your 
 browser, assuming you are connected to the Internet. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<span 
 style="margin-left: 18.00pt;"><!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Digital Candle 
 also offers a variety of alternative payment methods, such as Paypal, 
 purchase orders, cash, or cheque (check), via mail, phone (toll-free in 
 the US), or fax (in addition to standard online ordering), with no added 
 charge. </span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">You may also pay by regular mail directly 
 to us, with a check in US dollars. You can also pay in the equivalent 
 Australian currency (check a web site such as <span style="x-text-underline: normal; /*begin!kadov{{*/ text-decoration: underline; /*}}end!kadov*/ "><font 
 style="color: #0000ff;"
	color=#0000FF><a href="http://www.travlang.com/money"
					target=_blank>http://www.travlang.com/money</a></font></span> 
 for exchange rates). You can initiate registration via email but, for 
 security of your credit card number, you must still send payment via regular 
 mail. In either case, you should print and fill out the <a href="..\HID_REG_FORM.htm">Order 
 Form</a> and mail it to the listed address.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">Once your name and payment have been received, 
 you will be given instructions on how to register the software which will 
 also be sent to you by email. That’s all there is too it!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt; font-weight: bold;"><a name=Privacy>Privacy 
 Statement</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">Any information that you supply is kept 
 strictly confidential. In particular, any email address you supply is 
 not sold or made available to any other party. The email address is used 
 for registration instructions and to inform you of updates to the software 
 only.</p>
