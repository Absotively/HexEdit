.topic HIDC_DFFD_BITFIELD
Consecutive bit-fields with identical "Length" and "Direction" values are taken from the same underlying storage unit (which has Type of Integer and size as specified in Length field).  The Bits control (to the right) determines how many bits of the storage unit are used for this bit-field.

.topic HIDC_DFFD_BITFIELD_BITS
The number of bits of the storage unit used by this bit-field.  Whether bit-fields fill from the top or bottom is determined by the Direction control (to the right).  If the number of bits used by this and previous bit-fields would overflow the current storage unit then a new storage unit is started.  The number of bits must be less than Length x 8 (the maximum number of bits that can be placed in one storage unit).

.topic HIDC_DFFD_BITFIELD_DIRN
