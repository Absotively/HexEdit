This is the readme file for HexEdit version 3.1.

HexEdit 3.1 is a shareware, binary file editor or hex editor for Windows 9X/ME
/NT/2000/XP.  Internet Explorer 5.0 or later is required for some features
(noteably the on-line help and the template system).

A single-user licence is available for use on an unlimited numbers of machines
for $40 US.  Multi-user or site licences are available at a discount on
request.  The unregistered version works exactly like the registered version
for 30 days after which reminder messages are displayed.

The unregistered version is freely distributable.  All code, images etc 
are copyright 1999-2006 Expert Commercial Software Pty Ltd.

3.1 is typically distributed as a file called hexed3_1.msi.  This file
may in turn be stored in a zip file (with this readme) called hexed3_1.zip.
Hexed3_1.msi is a Microsoft Installer file that will install all
required files on your system.

To install Hexedit start hexed3_1.msi and follow the instructions.
Windows 2000/XP/Vista include the Microsoft Installer but if you
are using Windows 9X and you do not have the software already installed
you can download it from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads by searching for
"Microsoft Installer 95".

Note that HexEdit uses but does not install the shared Microsoft DLLs
MSVCRT.DLL and MFC42.DLL.  Just about everybody has the compatible
versions of these DLLs installed, so it was deemed unnecessary to
include them.  But if you do not have at least these versions:

MSVCRT.DLL   23 Apr 1999
MFC42.DLL    27 Apr 1999

in your windows system directory (normally C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM under
Windows 9X/ME or C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32 under Windows XP/2000/NT) then you
should obtain them from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads by searching
for "VCREDIST".

Extensive information on using HexEdit is provided in the on-line help.
If you are unable to run HexEdit for any reason you can open the help file
called HexEdit.CHM to view the troubleshooting section.
