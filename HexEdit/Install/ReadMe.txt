This is the readme file HexEdit 3.4.

HexEdit 3.4 is a shareware, binary file editor or hex editor for Windows
Vista/XP/2003/2000/ME/9X etc.  Internet Explorer 5.0 or later is required for
some features (notably the on-line help and the template system).

A single-user licence is available for $40 US.  Multi-user or site licences 
are available at a discount on request.  The unregistered version works exactly
like the registered version for 30 days after which reminders are displayed.

The unregistered version is freely distributable.  All code, images etc 
are copyright 1999-2010 Expert Commercial Software Pty Ltd.

3.4 is typically distributed as a file called hexed3_4.msi.  This file
may in turn be stored in a zip file (with this readme) called hexed3_4.zip.
Hexed3_4.msi is a Microsoft Installer file that will install all
required files on your system (apart from MFC DLLs - see below).

To install Hexedit start hexed3_4.msi and follow the instructions.
Windows 2000 and later includes the Microsoft Installer but if you
are using Windows 9X and you do not have the software already installed
you can download it from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads by searching for
"Microsoft Installer 95".

Note that HexEdit uses but does not install the shared Microsoft DLLs
MSVCR71.DLL and MFC71.DLL.  If you do not have these files. for example,
in your windows system directory (normally C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM under
Windows 9X/ME or C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32 under Windows XP/2000/NT) then you
can download the DLLs from the Internet.

Extensive information on using HexEdit is provided in the on-line help.
If you are unable to run HexEdit for any reason you can open the help file
called HexEdit.CHM to view the troubleshooting section.

"HexEdit" in the subject line to avoid the email being filtered.)
