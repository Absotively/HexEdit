HexEdit 3.3 Release Notes
=========================

Version 3.3 has reorganised and simplified the Options dialog and added more than a dozen new options.  A major new feature is the addition of the "Explorer" window.  Other new features are support for real48 (as used in Turbo Pascal and Delphi), ruler, and line numbers.

Several new functions have been added to expressions including GetInt, GetString and GetBool, which allow input from the user and are very useful for chnaging the behaviour of templates under user control.
