 - in window options turning autofit on (Apply) does not update window columns
 > drag onto main window to open does not set open_current_readonly_
 > can't send attachment if it's open modeReadWrite

 - bg_search_ for device problem
 - find dlg char set (Text page) updates after chnaging char set or rest but not other times (eg undo)
   - could put in end_change() but this would mean it is chnaged irrespective of previous char set
   - see HexEditView.cpp "RB_CHARSET_EBCDIC" and "RB_CHARSET_ASCII"

 - when displaying strings in calculator escape double-quote (and other special chars)
 - in tree view size of 1/2 byte ints is shown as 4??
 - template bug: when reading ntoskrnl.exe and max fix for=20 then sections treated as fixed but are variable
 - recorded/saved num search alignment=8, restart, load, run found background occurrence where alignment != 8, could not repeat
 ? caret hides character (block caret) when left click under Windows 98 (not W2K)
 - if reset display turns off autofit and squeezes offset then save offset for undo?
 - cancel File/SaveAs dialog loses icon
 - file open/save dialogs' types [?????(*.*)]
 - ASSERT(wait_status == WAIT_OBJECT_0); on close if no search done
 - icon (top left) gets messed up
 ? somehow caret disappeared in one window when using find/goto tools (F4, F5, F6 etc)
 ? some how got ¦"~abc" into find dlg edit control rather than "abc" when selecting from hist list and
   changing between ASCII/EBCDIC
 - some printer drivers (eg text only) return GetDeviceCaps(VERTRES)=66

Tip of Day
  - type expression into jump tools
  - print selection to not see repeated lines
  - bookmark
DFFD Editing

 - make sure var names do not have spaces
 - domain var menu to include "this"
 - drag&drop: expand if over struct, SHIFT for replace (works for if/for sub-element)
 - allow drag between struct elements - use GetDC to draw arrows
 - when saving default.xml use save as
 - after save-as change to saved template name
 > locn of XML template files
 - allow for current FOR name in expression menus

 - add area to website to submit and retrieve XML DFFD templates
 - handle location of XML files and DTD (options dlg/registry)
 - avoid GetAttr in sym_found by storing names?
 - avoid GetAttr for array elts (name not used and would all be the same anyway)
 - reduce GetAttr & GetData calls (cache?)
 > handle byte order?
 - handle IBM.OEM and Unicode char/strings
 - handle s+m and 1's comp ints
 - test errors in expressions, better explanation of where file/XML is wrong

Bugs
 Unfixable bugs
  - use file association to open file with spaces gives error (MFC/Windows bug)
  - MaxPage is only 16 bits - MFC or Win 95 restriction???
 Unreproducible bugs
  - after F9 then error message "There is no active window" OK but then hangs (29/7/99)
  - open MRU fails then it opens the next (sometimes)
  - selection from eoln backwards bug
  - if prop dlg half off left edge and caret approaches from below => inf. move loop
  - DisplayCaret: if end of selection at EOLN then may leave selection just above display
    - revert to old DisplayCaret that considered all of selection???
 Later
  - stress test
  - call FixFileButtons when
    - mark changed (affects Mk+ etc)
    - selection changed (affects store @, sel len store etc)
    - RO/RW toggled (affects store @ buttons),
    - length changed (affects @buttons etc)
  - tools disabled in kill focus and destroy - both not necessary
  - Scroll when shift selecting causes flicker
 Test
  - Insuff memory seems to be handled but can't be caught with catch(bad_alloc)
  - when/if long double becomes IEEE 80 bit, test that last 3 bits of IBM 64 bit FP value are OK

User requests
  - column select [?]
  - read memory of other tasks
  - decompile macros + loop and branch commands

Possible Features
 - web site
   - new look (Greek or other symbols?)
   - benchmarks (search, compare, open, goto) (CF vedit 2 million replaces in 2 mins, on P166)
 - Option to allow scroll past ends (default off) in CScrView
    - fix scroll bar down/right arrows to handle this option
    - fix key down/right to handle this
 - auto completion in Find dialog/tool from history
 - new properties
	- add checksum/CRC page to property sheet (current selection) [Fabien Clement]
		- for 16 and 32 bit values byte order matters for checksum (and CRC?)
		- need to display the result as hex or decimal
	- adds stats page (background processing does stats if enabled)
		- character frequency counts? (read whole file in background?)
		- count of current find string?
	- character frequency counts? (read whole file in background?)
 - new options
	- bits on/off mask (byte,16-bit,32-bit,64-bit?)
	- check box for property pages to display
		- File Properties
		- Character
		- Decimal
		- IEEE f.p.
		- IBM f.p. (default off)
		- Checksum/CRC (default off)
		- Statistics (enables background processing)
	- general options
		- ASCII/insensitive escape chars
		- # of saved search strings, # in recent file list
	- save last goto addresses etc
  - add-In DLLs to handle certain types of files
	- associate file extension with DLL
	- some sort of standard DLL calls: next, previous, summarize
	- next/previous to have mutliple (unlimited?) levels of records
  - section break option (allows diff rowsize_, offset_, grouping_ etc)
  - aerial view? - one pixel (colour coded) for each byte;
    - colour coding according to ranges (below)
    - zoom level buttons (1/9,1/4,1,4,9,16,25 bytes -> 1 pixel)
    - current search text (all locations) appears as special colour
    - valid bytes (ASCII or EBCDIC) darker than others
    - nul bytes blank
    - click on pixel to move to that location
    - display in dockable control bar or separate view??
    - bitmap: highest zoom is 1 stored pixel == 32x32 characters
      - files above 1 Gbyte only allow 32x32 (needs 1000th of storage)
      - files 256K to 1 Gb allow 16x16 and 32x32 (1Gb file needs 4Mb)
      - files 64-256K have 8x8, 16x16, 32x32 (256K needs 4Mb) etc
